# Athena-Framework Skill

Use this skill when working with athena framework for crystal. athena is a modular ecosystem of independent, reusable components including: framework (ath) for web apps, dependencyinjection (adi) for ioc containers, routing (art) for http routing, serializer (asr) for object serialization, validator (avd) for validation, console (acon) for cli tools, eventdispatcher (aed) for event-driven architecture, and more. use for building crystal web applications, rest apis, cli tools, or integrating individual components., generated from official documentation.

## When to Use This Skill

**Pattern 2:** Extension of ACTR::EventDispatcher::Event to add additional functionality

```
Athena::Validator::Constraint
```

**Pattern 4:** Athena::Validator validates values/objects against a set of constraints, i

```
Athena::Validator

**Pattern 5:** Routing GitHub Introduction Back to Manual API API Aliases Top Level Annotations Annotations Delete Get Head Link Patch Post Put Route Unlink Compi...

```
Athena::Routing::Route
```

**Pattern 6:** Provides an object-oriented way to represent an HTTP route, including the path, methods, schemes, host, and/or conditions required for it to match

```
ART::Route
```

**Pattern 7:** By default, all parameters are required, meaning given the path /blog/{page}, /blog/10 would match but /blog would NOT match

```
/blog/{page}
```

**Pattern 8:** Serializer GitHub Introduction Back to Manual API API Aliases Top Level Annotations Annotations Accessor AccessorOrder Discriminator Exclude Exclus...

```
Athena::Serializer::Annotations::Expose
```

### Example Code Patterns

**Example 1** (julia):
```julia
route = ART::Route.new "/contact"
route.condition do |context, request|
  request.headers["user-agent"].includes? "Firefox"
end
```

**Example 2** (php):
```php
ASPEC::Methods.assert_compile_time_error "can't instantiate abstract class Foo", <<-CR
  abstract class Foo; end
  Foo.new
CR
```

**Example 3** (r):
```r
ASPEC::Methods.assert_compiles <<-CR
  raise "Still passes"
CR
```
