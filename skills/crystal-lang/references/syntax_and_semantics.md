Weak Reference class that allows a referenced object to be garbage-collected.

WARNING The referenced object cannot be a module.

NOTE To use WeakRef, you must explicitly import it with require "weak_ref"

Note that the collection of objects is not deterministic, and depends on many subtle aspects. For instance, if the example above is modified to print ref.value in the first print, then the collector will not collect it.

Returns the referenced object or Nil if it has been garbage-collected.

Returns the referenced object or Nil if it has been garbage-collected.

**Examples:**

Example 1 (javascript):
```javascript
require "weak_ref"

ref = WeakRef.new("oof".reverse)
p ref # => #<WeakRef(String):0x7f83406eafa0 @target=Pointer(Void)@0x7f83406eafc0>
GC.collect
p ref       # => #<WeakRef(String):0x7f83406eafa0 @target=Pointer(Void).null>

The Macros module is a fictitious module used to document macros and macro methods.

You can invoke a fixed subset of methods on AST nodes at compile-time. These methods are documented on the classes in this module. Additionally, methods of the Macros module are top-level methods that you can invoke, like #puts and #run.

Executes a system command and returns the output as a MacroId.

Returns the alignment of the given type as number of bytes.

Compares two semantic versions.

Outputs the current macro's buffer to the standard output.

Gets the value of an environment variable at compile-time, or nil if it doesn't exist.

Returns true if the given filename exists, false otherwise.

Returns whether a compile-time flag is set.

Returns whether a compile-time flag is set for the host platform, which can differ from the target platform (#flag?) during cross-compilation.

Prints macro expressions together with their values at compile-time.

Parses type_name into a Path, Generic (also used for unions), ProcNotation, or Metaclass.

Prints AST nodes at compile-time.

Prints AST nodes at compile-time.

Gives a compile-time error with the given message.

Reads a file and returns a StringLiteral with its contents.

Same as #read_file, except that nil is returned on any I/O failure instead of issuing a compile-time failure.

Compiles and execute a Crystal program and returns its output as a MacroId.

Returns the size of the given type as number of bytes.

Skips the rest of the file from which it is executed.

Executes a system command and returns the output as a MacroId.

Emits a compile-time warning with the given message.

Executes a system command and returns the output as a MacroId. Gives a compile-time error if the command failed to execute.

It is impossible to call this method with any regular call syntax. There is an associated literal type which calls the method with the literal content as command:

See Command literals in the language reference.

Returns the alignment of the given type as number of bytes.

type must be a constant referring to a stable type. It cannot be evaluated at macro evaluation time, nor a typeof expression.

See #sizeof for the definition of a stable type.

NOTE This is a pseudo-method provided directly by the Crystal compiler. It cannot be redefined nor overridden.

Compares two semantic versions.

Returns -1, 0 or 1 depending on whether v1 is lower than v2, equal to v2 or greater than v2.

Outputs the current macro's buffer to the standard output. Useful for debugging a macro to see what's being generated.

By default, the output is tried to be formatted using Crystal's formatter, but you can disable this by passing false to this method.

Gets the value of an environment variable at compile-time, or nil if it doesn't exist.

Returns true if the given filename exists, false otherwise.

Returns whether a compile-time flag is set.

Returns whether a compile-time flag is set for the host platform, which can differ from the target platform (#flag?) during cross-compilation.

Prints macro expressions together with their values at compile-time. Useful for debugging macros.

Parses type_name into a Path, Generic (also used for unions), ProcNotation, or Metaclass.

The #resolve method could then be used to resolve the value into a TypeNode, if the type_name represents a type, otherwise the value of the constant.

A compile time error is raised if the type/constant does not actually exist, or if a required generic argument was not provided.

Prints AST nodes at compile-time. Useful for debugging macros.

Prints AST nodes at compile-time. Useful for debugging macros.

Gives a compile-time error with the given message.

Reads a file and returns a StringLiteral with its contents.

Gives a compile-time error if the file doesn't exist or if reading the file fails.

To read a file relative to where the macro is defined, use:

NOTE Relative paths are resolved to the current working directory.

Same as #read_file, except that nil is returned on any I/O failure instead of issuing a compile-time failure.

Compiles and execute a Crystal program and returns its output as a MacroId.

The file denoted by filename must be a valid Crystal program. This macro invocation passes args to the program as regular program arguments. This output is the result of this macro invocation, as a MacroId.

The #run macro is useful when the subset of available macro methods are not enough for your purposes and you need something more powerful. With #run you can read files at compile time, connect to the internet or to a database.

The above generates a program that will have the contents of some_file.txt. The file, however, is read at compile time and will not be needed at runtime.

NOTE the compiler is allowed to cache the executable generated for filename and only recompile it if any of the files it depends on changes (their modified time). This is why it's strongly discouraged to use a program for #run that changes in subsequent compilations (for example, if it executes shell commands at compile time, or other macro run programs). It's also strongly discouraged to have a macro run program take a lot of time, because this will slow down compilation times. Reading files is OK, opening an HTTP connection at compile-time will most likely result in very slow compilations.

Returns the size of the given type as number of bytes.

For definition purposes, a type is considered to be stable if its size and alignment do not change as new code is being processed. Currently, all Crystal types are stable, except the following:

type must be a constant referring to a stable type. It cannot be evaluated at macro evaluation time, nor a typeof expression.

NOTE This is a pseudo-method provided directly by the Crystal compiler. It cannot be redefined nor overridden.

Skips the rest of the file from which it is executed. Typical usage is to skip files that have platform specific code, without having to surround the most relevant code in {% if flag?(...) %} ... {% end %} macro blocks.

Executes a system command and returns the output as a MacroId. Gives a compile-time error if the command failed to execute.

Emits a compile-time warning with the given message.

**Examples:**

Example 1 (json):
```json
{{ `echo hi` }} # => "hi\n"
```

Example 2 (json):
```json
{{ alignof(Int32) }} # => 4
{{ alignof(Void*) }} # usually 4 or 8
```

Example 3 (json):
```json
{{ compare_versions("1.10.0", "1.2.0") }} # => 1
```

BitArray is an array data structure that compactly stores bits.

Bits externally represented as Bools are stored internally as UInt32s. The total number of bits stored is set at creation and is immutable.

NOTE To use BitArray, you must explicitly import it with require "bit_array"

Creates a new BitArray of size bits.

Creates a new BitArray of size bits and invokes the given block once for each index of self, setting the bit at that index to true if the block is truthy.

Returns count or less (if there aren't enough) elements starting at the given start index.

Returns all elements that are within the given range.

Sets the given value at the given index.

Returns true if all of the elements of the collection are truthy.

Returns true if at least one of the collection's members is truthy.

Returns the number of times that item is present in the bit array.

Returns a new BitArray with all of the same elements.

Replaces count or less (if there aren't enough) elements starting at the given start index with value.

Replaces every element in self with the given value.

See Object#hash(hasher)

Returns true if the collection contains obj, false otherwise.

Returns the index of the first appearance of obj in self starting from the given offset, or nil if the value is not in self.

Creates a string representation of self.

Inverts all bits in the array.

Returns true if all of the elements of the collection are falsey.

Returns true if only one element in this enumerable is truthy.

Reverses in-place all the elements of self.

Returns the index of the last appearance of obj in self, or nil if obj is not in self.

Shifts all elements of self to the left n times.

The number of bits the BitArray stores

Tallies the collection.

Tallies the collection.

Creates a string representation of self.

Returns a Bytes able to read and write bytes from a buffer.

Toggles count or less (if there aren't enough) bits starting at the given start index.

Toggles all bits that are within the given range.

Toggles the bit at the given index.

Returns the element at the given index, without doing any bounds check.

Sets the element at the given index to value, without doing any bounds check.

Creates a new BitArray of size bits.

initial optionally sets the starting value, true or false, for all bits in the array.

Creates a new BitArray of size bits and invokes the given block once for each index of self, setting the bit at that index to true if the block is truthy.

Returns count or less (if there aren't enough) elements starting at the given start index.

Negative indices count backward from the end of the array (-1 is the last element). Additionally, an empty array is returned when the starting index for an element range is at the end of the array.

Raises IndexError if the starting index is out of range.

Returns all elements that are within the given range.

Negative indices count backward from the end of the array (-1 is the last element). Additionally, an empty array is returned when the starting index for an element range is at the end of the array.

Raises IndexError if the starting index is out of range.

Sets the given value at the given index. Returns value.

Negative indices can be used to start counting from the end of the container. Raises IndexError if trying to set an element outside the container's range.

Returns true if all of the elements of the collection are truthy.

Returns true if at least one of the collection's members is truthy.

NOTE #any? usually has the same semantics as #present?. They only differ if the element type can be falsey (i.e. T <= Nil || T <= Pointer || T <= Bool). It's typically advised to prefer #present? unless these specific truthiness semantics are required.

Returns the number of times that item is present in the bit array.

Returns a new BitArray with all of the same elements.

Replaces count or less (if there aren't enough) elements starting at the given start index with value. Returns self.

Negative values of start count from the end of the container.

Raises IndexError if the start index is out of range.

Raises ArgumentError if count is negative.

Replaces every element in self with the given value. Returns self.

See Object#hash(hasher)

Returns true if the collection contains obj, false otherwise.

Returns the index of the first appearance of obj in self starting from the given offset, or nil if the value is not in self.

Creates a string representation of self.

Inverts all bits in the array. Falses become true and vice versa.

Returns true if all of the elements of the collection are falsey.

It's the opposite of #all?.

Returns true if only one element in this enumerable is truthy.

Reverses in-place all the elements of self. Returns self.

Returns the index of the last appearance of obj in self, or nil if obj is not in self.

If offset is given, the search starts from that index towards the first elements in self.

Shifts all elements of self to the left n times. Returns self.

The number of bits the BitArray stores

Tallies the collection. Accepts a hash to count occurrences. The value corresponding to each element must be an integer. The number of occurrences is added to each value in hash, and hash is returned.

Tallies the collection. Returns a hash where the keys are the elements and the values are numbers of elements in the collection that correspond to the key.

Creates a string representation of self.

Returns a Bytes able to read and write bytes from a buffer. The slice will be long enough to hold all the bits groups in bytes despite the UInt32 internal representation. It's useful for reading and writing a bit array from a byte buffer directly.

WARNING It is undefined behaviour to set any of the unused bits of a bit array to true via a slice.

Toggles count or less (if there aren't enough) bits starting at the given start index. A false bit becomes a true bit, and vice versa.

Negative indices count backward from the end of the array (-1 is the last element).

Raises IndexError if index is out of range. Raises ArgumentError if count is a negative number.

Toggles all bits that are within the given range. A false bit becomes a true bit, and vice versa.

Negative indices count backward from the end of the array (-1 is the last element).

Raises IndexError if the starting index is out of range.

Toggles the bit at the given index. A false bit becomes a true bit, and vice versa.

Negative indices count backward from the end of the array (-1 is the last element).

Raises IndexError if index is out of range.

Returns the element at the given index, without doing any bounds check.

Indexable makes sure to invoke this method with index in 0...size, so converting negative indices to positive ones is not needed here.

Clients never invoke this method directly. Instead, they access elements with #[](index) and #[]?(index).

This method should only be directly invoked if you are absolutely sure the index is in bounds, to avoid a bounds check for a small boost of performance.

Sets the element at the given index to value, without doing any bounds check.

Indexable::Mutable makes sure to invoke this method with index in 0...size, so converting negative indices to positive ones is not needed here.

Clients never invoke this method directly. Instead, they modify elements with #[]=(index, value).

This method should only be directly invoked if you are absolutely sure the index is in bounds, to avoid a bounds check for a small boost of performance.

ba[2]                 # => false
0.upto(5) { |i| ba[i * 2] = true }

A typed pointer to some memory.

This is the only unsafe type in Crystal. If you are using a pointer, you are writing unsafe code because a pointer doesn't know where it's pointing to nor how much memory starting from it is valid. However, pointers make it possible to interface with C and to implement efficient data structures. For example, both Array and Hash are implemented using pointers.

You can obtain pointers in four ways: #new, #malloc, pointerof, or by calling a C function that returns a pointer.

pointerof(x), where x is a variable or an instance variable, returns a pointer to that variable:

Use #value to dereference the pointer.

Note that a pointer is falsey if it's null (if its address is zero).

When calling a C function that expects a pointer you can also pass nil instead of using Pointer.null to construct a null pointer.

For a safe alternative, see Slice, which is a pointer with a size and with bounds checking.

Returns a pointer that points to the given memory address.

Allocates size * sizeof(T) bytes from the system's heap initialized to value and returns a pointer to the first byte from that memory. The memory is allocated by the GC, so when there are no pointers to this memory, it will be automatically freed.

Allocates size * sizeof(T) bytes from the system's heap initialized to zero and returns a pointer to the first byte from that memory. The memory is allocated by the GC, so when there are no pointers to this memory, it will be automatically freed.

The implementation uses GC.malloc if the compiler is aware that the allocated type contains inner address pointers. See Crystal::Macros::TypeNode#has_inner_pointers? for details.

To override this implicit behaviour, GC.malloc and GC.malloc_atomic can be used directly instead.

Allocates size * sizeof(T) bytes from the system's heap initialized to zero and returns a pointer to the first byte from that memory. The memory is allocated by the GC, so when there are no pointers to this memory, it will be automatically freed.

Returns the address of this pointer.

Sets count consecutive values pointed by this pointer to the values returned by the block.

Like #map!, but yields 2 arguments, the element and its index

Accepts an optional offset parameter, which tells it to start counting from there.

Compares count elements from this pointer and other, lexicographically.

Returns 0 if both pointers point to the same sequence of count bytes. Otherwise, if the first two differing bytes (treated as UInt8) from self and other are x and y respectively, returns a negative value if x < y, or a positive value if x > y.

Copies count elements from source into self. source and self may overlap; the copy is always done in a non-destructive manner.

Copies count elements from self into target. target and self may overlap; the copy is always done in a non-destructive manner.

Returns true if this pointer's address is zero.

Tries to change the size of the allocation pointed to by this pointer to size, and returns that pointer.

Since the space after the end of the block may be in use, realloc may find it necessary to copy the block to a new address where more free space is available. The value of realloc is the new address of the block. If the block needs to be moved, realloc copies the old contents.

Remember to always assign the value of realloc.

**Contents:**
- lib¶
- Reflection¶

A lib declaration groups C functions and types that belong to a library.

Although not enforced by the compiler, a lib's name usually starts with Lib.

Attributes are used to pass flags to the linker to find external libraries:

Attributes can be omitted if the library is implicitly linked, as in the case of libc.

Lib functions are visible in the macro language anywhere in the program using the method TypeNode#methods:

**Examples:**

Example 1 (swift):
```swift
@[Link("pcre")]
lib LibPCRE
end
```

Example 2 (json):
```json
lib LibFoo
  fun foo
end

{{ LibFoo.methods }} # => [fun foo]

## Inheritance¶

**URL:** https://crystal-lang.org/reference/1.18/syntax_and_semantics/inheritance.html

**Contents:**
- Inheritance¶
- super¶
- Covariance and Contravariance¶

Every class except Object, the hierarchy root, inherits from another class (its superclass). If you don't specify one it defaults to Reference for classes and Struct for structs.

A class inherits all instance variables and all instance and class methods of a superclass, including its constructors (new and initialize).

If a class defines a new or initialize then its superclass constructors are not inherited:

You can override methods in a derived class:

Instead of overriding you can define specialized methods by using type restrictions:

You can invoke a superclass' method using super:

Without arguments or parentheses, super receives all of the method's parameters as arguments. Otherwise, it receives the arguments you pass to it.

One place inheritance can get a little tricky is with arrays. We have to be careful when declaring an array of objects where inheritance is used. For example, consider the following

A Foo array can hold both Foo's and Bar's, but an array of Bar can only hold Bar and its subclasses.

One place this might trip you up is when automatic casting comes into play. For example, the following won't work:

we've declared @arr as type Array(Foo) so we may be tempted to think that we can start putting Bars in there. Not quite. In the initialize, the type of the [Bar.new] expression is Array(Bar), period. And Array(Bar) is not assignable to an Array(Foo) instance var.

What's the right way to do this? Change the expression so that it is of the right type: Array(Foo) (see example above).

This is just one type (Array) and one operation (assignment), the logic of the above will be applied differently for other types and assignments, in general Covariance and Contravariance is not fully supported.

**Examples:**

Example 1 (python):
```python
class Person
  def initialize(@name : String)
  end

  def greet
    puts "Hi, I'm #{@name}"
  end
end

class Employee < Person
end

employee = Employee.new "John"
employee.greet # "Hi, I'm John"
```

Example 2 (python):
```python
class Person
  def initialize(@name : String)
  end
end

class Employee < Person
  def initialize(@name : String, @company_name : String)
  end
end

Employee.new "John", "Acme" # OK
Employee.new "Peter"        # Error: wrong number of arguments for 'Employee:Class#new' (1 for 2)
```

Example 3 (php):
```php
class Person
  def greet(msg)
    puts "Hi, #{msg}"
  end
end

class Employee < Person
  def greet(msg)
    puts "Hello, #{msg}"
  end
end

p = Person.new
p.greet "everyone" # "Hi, everyone"

e = Employee.new
e.greet "everyone" # "Hello, everyone"
```

Example 4 (php):
```php
class Person
  def greet(msg)
    puts "Hi, #{msg}"
  end
end

class Employee < Person
  def greet(msg : Int32)
    puts "Hi, this is a number: #{msg}"
  end
end

e = Employee.new
e.greet "everyone" # "Hi, everyone"

e.greet 1 # "Hi, this is a number: 1"
```

A fixed-size, stack allocated array.

StaticArray is a generic type with type argument T specifying the type of its elements and N the fixed size. For example StaticArray(Int32, 3) is a static array of Int32 with three elements.

Instantiations of this static array type:

This type can also be expressed as Int32[3] (only in type grammar). A typical use case is in combination with uninitialized:

For number types there is also Number.static_array which can be used to initialize a static array:

The generic argument type N is a special case in the type grammar as it doesn't specify a type but a size. Its value can be an Int32 literal or constant.

Creates a new static array and invokes the block once for each index of the array, assigning the block's value in that index.

Creates a new static array filled with the given value.

Returns the index of the first appearance of object in self starting from the given offset, or nil if object is not in self.

Returns a new static array where elements are mapped by the given block.

Like #map, but the block gets passed both the element and its index.

Shifts all elements of self to the left n times.

Returns the size of self

Returns a new instance with all elements sorted based on the return value of their comparison method T#<=> (see Comparable#<=>), using a stable sort algorithm.

Returns a new instance with all elements sorted based on the comparator in the given block, using a stable sort algorithm.

Sorts all elements in self based on the return value of the comparison method T#<=> (see Comparable#<=>), using a stable sort algorithm.

## Exception handling¶

**Contents:**
- Exception handling¶
- Raising exception¶
- Defining custom exceptions¶
- Rescuing exceptions¶
- else¶
- ensure¶
- Short syntax form¶
- Suffix forms of rescue and ensure¶
- Type inference¶
- Alternative ways to do error handling¶

Crystal's way to do error handling is by raising and rescuing exceptions.

You raise exceptions by invoking a top-level raise method. Unlike other keywords, raise is a regular method with two overloads: one accepting a String and another accepting an Exception instance:

The String version just creates a new Exception instance with that message.

Only Exception instances or subclasses can be raised.

To define a custom exception type, just subclass from Exception:

You can, as always, define a constructor for your exception or just use the default one.

To rescue any exception use a begin ... rescue ... end expression:

To access the rescued exception you can specify a variable in the rescue clause:

To rescue just one type of exception (or any of its subclasses):

Valid type restrictions are subclasses of ::Exception, module types and unions of these.

And to access it, use a syntax similar to type restrictions:

Multiple rescue clauses can be specified:

You can also rescue multiple exception types at once by specifying a union type:

An else clause is executed only if no exceptions were rescued:

An else clause can only be specified if at least one rescue clause is specified.

An ensure clause is executed at the end of a begin ... end or begin ... rescue ... end expression regardless of whether an exception was raised or not:

ensure clauses are usually used for clean up, freeing resources, etc.

Exception handling has a short syntax form: assume a method or block definition is an implicit begin ... end expression, then specify rescue, else, and ensure clauses:

You can use the suffix form of rescue to create one-liner catch-all exception handling. You cannot specify an Exception type to rescue when using its suffix form.

You may also use the suffix form of ensure to create one-liner guarantees similar to rescue.

Variables declared inside the begin part of an exception handler also get the Nil type when considered inside a rescue or ensure body. For example:

The above happens even if something_dangerous_that_returns_Int32 never raises, or if a was assigned a value and then a method that potentially raises is executed:

Although it is obvious that a will always be assigned a value, the compiler will still think a might never had a chance to be initialized. Even though this logic might improve in the future, right now it forces you to keep your exception handlers to their necessary minimum, making the code's intention more clear:

Although exceptions are available as one of the mechanisms for handling errors, they are not your only choice. Raising an exception involves allocating memory, and executing an exception handler is generally slow.

The standard library usually provides a couple of methods to accomplish something: one raises, one returns nil. For example:

The usual convention is to provide an alternative "question" method to signal that this variant of the method returns nil instead of raising. This lets the user choose whether they want to deal with exceptions or with nil. Note, however, that this is not available for every method out there, as exceptions are still the preferred way because they don't pollute the code with error handling logic.

**Examples:**

Example 1 (unknown):
```unknown
raise "OH NO!"
raise Exception.new("Some error")
```

Example 2 (php):
```php
class MyException < Exception
end

class MyOtherException < Exception
end
```

Example 3 (markdown):
```markdown
begin
  raise "OH NO!"
rescue
  puts "Rescued!"
end

# Output: Rescued!
```

Example 4 (markdown):
```markdown
begin
  raise "OH NO!"
rescue ex
  puts ex.message
end

# Output: OH NO!
```

**Contents:**
- Class variables¶

Class variables are associated to classes instead of instances. They are prefixed with two "at" signs (@@). For example:

Class variables can be read and written from class methods or instance methods.

Their type is inferred using the global type inference algorithm.

Class variables are inherited by subclasses with this meaning: their type is the same, but each class has a different runtime value. For example:

Class variables can also be associated to modules and structs. Like above, they are inherited by including/subclassing types.

**Examples:**

Example 1 (swift):
```swift
class Counter
  @@instances = 0

  def initialize
    @@instances += 1
  end

  def self.instances
    @@instances
  end
end

Counter.instances # => 0
Counter.new
Counter.new
Counter.new
Counter.instances # => 3
```

Example 2 (swift):
```swift
class Parent
  @@numbers = [] of Int32

  def self.numbers
    @@numbers
  end
end

class Child < Parent
end

Parent.numbers # => []
Child.numbers  # => []

Value is the base type of the primitive types (Nil, Bool, Char, Number), Symbol, Pointer, Tuple, StaticArray and all structs.

A Value is passed by value: when you pass it to methods, return it from methods or assign it to variables, a copy of the value is actually passed. This is not important for nil, bools, integers, floats, symbols, pointers and tuples, because they are immutable, but with a mutable Struct or with a StaticArray you have to be careful. Read their documentation to learn more about this.

## Callbacks¶

**URL:** https://crystal-lang.org/reference/1.18/syntax_and_semantics/c_bindings/callbacks.html

**Contents:**
- Callbacks¶
- Passing a closure to a C function¶
- Raises annotation¶

You can use function types in C declarations:

Then you can pass a function (a Proc) like this:

If you define the function inline in the same call you can omit the parameter types, the compiler will add the types for you based on the fun signature:

Note, however, that functions passed to C can't form closures. If the compiler detects at compile-time that a closure is being passed, an error will be issued:

If the compiler can't detect this at compile-time, an exception will be raised at runtime.

Refer to the type grammar for the notation used in callbacks and procs types.

If you want to pass NULL instead of a callback, just pass nil:

Most of the time a C function that allows setting a callback also provides a parameter for custom data. This custom data is then sent as an argument to the callback. For example, suppose a C function that invokes a callback at every tick, passing that tick:

To properly define a wrapper for this function we must send the Proc as the callback data, and then convert that callback data to the Proc and finally invoke it.

Note that we save the boxed callback in @@box. The reason is that if we don't do it, and our code doesn't reference it anymore, the GC will collect it. The C library will of course store the callback, but Crystal's GC has no way of knowing that.

If a C function executes a user-provided callback that might raise, it must be annotated with the @[Raises] annotation.

The compiler infers this annotation for a method if it invokes a method that is marked as @[Raises] or raises (recursively).

However, some C functions accept callbacks to be executed by other C functions. For example, suppose a fictitious library:

If the callback passed to store_callback raises, then execute_callback will raise. However, the compiler doesn't know that execute_callback can potentially raise because it is not marked as @[Raises] and the compiler has no way to figure this out. In these cases you have to manually mark such functions:

If you don't mark them, begin/rescue blocks that surround this function's calls won't work as expected.

**Examples:**

Example 1 (cpp):
```cpp
lib X
  # In C:
  #
  #    void callback(int (*f)(int));
  fun callback(f : Int32 -> Int32)
end
```

Example 2 (php):
```php
f = ->(x : Int32) { x + 1 }
X.callback(f)
```

Example 3 (php):
```php
X.callback ->(x) { x + 1 }
```

Example 4 (php):
```php
y = 2
X.callback ->(x) { x + y } # Error: can't send closure to C function
```

A string pool is a collection of strings. It allows a runtime to save memory by preserving strings in a pool, allowing to reuse an instance of a common string instead of creating a new one.

NOTE To use StringPool, you must explicitly import it with require "string_pool"

Creates a new empty string pool.

Returns true if the StringPool has no element otherwise returns false.

Returns a String with the contents given by the pointer str of size len.

Returns a String with the contents of the given slice.

Returns a String with the contents of the given IO::Memory.

Returns a String with the contents of the given string.

Returns a String with the contents given by the pointer str of size len, or nil if no such string exists in the pool.

Returns a String with the contents of the given slice, or nil if no such string exists in the pool.

Returns a String with the contents of the given IO::Memory, or nil if no such string exists in the pool.

Returns a String with the contents of the given string, or nil if no such string exists in the pool.

Rebuilds the hash based on the current hash values for each key, if values of key objects have changed since they were inserted.

Creates a new empty string pool.

The initial_capacity is useful to avoid unnecessary reallocations of the internal buffers in case of growth. If you have an estimate of the maximum number of elements the pool will hold it should be initialized with that capacity for improved performance. Inputs lower than 8 are ignored.

Returns true if the StringPool has no element otherwise returns false.

Returns a String with the contents given by the pointer str of size len.

If a string with those contents was already present in the pool, that one is returned. Otherwise a new string is created, put in the pool and returned.

Returns a String with the contents of the given slice.

If a string with those contents was already present in the pool, that one is returned. Otherwise a new string is created, put in the pool and returned.

Returns a String with the contents of the given IO::Memory.

If a string with those contents was already present in the pool, that one is returned. Otherwise a new string is created, put in the pool and returned.

Returns a String with the contents of the given string.

If a string with those contents was already present in the pool, that one is returned. Otherwise a new string is created, put in the pool and returned.

Returns a String with the contents given by the pointer str of size len, or nil if no such string exists in the pool.

Returns a String with the contents of the given IO::Memory, or nil if no such string exists in the pool.

Returns a String with the contents of the given string, or nil if no such string exists in the pool.

Rebuilds the hash based on the current hash values for each key, if values of key objects have changed since they were inserted.

Call this method if you modified a string submitted to the pool.

**Examples:**

Example 1 (javascript):
```javascript
require "string_pool"

pool = StringPool.new
a = "foo" + "bar"
b = "foo" + "bar"
a.object_id # => 136294360
b.object_id # => 136294336
a = pool.get(a)
b = pool.get(b)
a.object_id # => 136294312
b.object_id # => 136294312
```

Example 2 (javascript):
```javascript
pool = StringPool.new(256)
pool.size # => 0
```

Example 3 (javascript):
```javascript
require "string_pool"

pool = StringPool.new
pool.empty? # => true
pool.get("crystal")
pool.empty? # => false
```

Example 4 (javascript):

require "string_pool"

pool = StringPool.new
pool.get("hey".to_unsafe, 3)

Isolated execution context to run a single fiber.

Concurrency and parallelism are disabled. The context guarantees that the fiber will always run on the same system thread until it terminates; the fiber owns the system thread for its whole lifetime.

Keep in mind that the fiber will still run in parallel to other fibers running in other execution contexts at the same time.

Concurrency is disabled, so an isolated fiber can't spawn fibers into the context, but it can spawn fibers into other execution contexts. Since it can be inconvenient to pass an execution context around, calls to ::spawn will spawn a fiber into the specified spawn_context during initialization, which defaults to Fiber::ExecutionContext.default.

Isolated fibers can normally communicate with other fibers running in other execution contexts using Channel, WaitGroup or Mutex for example. They can also execute IO operations or sleep just like any other fiber.

Calls that result in waiting (e.g. sleep, or socket read/write) will block the thread since there are no other fibers to switch to. This in turn allows to call anything that would block the thread without blocking any other fiber.

For example you can start an isolated fiber to run a blocking GUI loop, transparently forward ::spawn to the default context, then keep the main fiber to wait until the GUI application quit:

Starts a new thread named name to execute func.

Appends a String representation of this object which includes its class name, its object address and the values of all instance variables.

Instantiates a fiber and enqueues it into the scheduler's local queue.

Returns the current status of the scheduler.

Appends a short String representation of this object which includes its class name and its object address.

Blocks the calling fiber until the isolated context fiber terminates.

Starts a new thread named name to execute func. Once func returns the thread will terminate.

Appends a String representation of this object which includes its class name, its object address and the values of all instance variables.

Instantiates a fiber and enqueues it into the scheduler's local queue.

Returns the current status of the scheduler. For example "running", "event-loop" or "parked".

Appends a short String representation of this object which includes its class name and its object address.

Blocks the calling fiber until the isolated context fiber terminates. Returns immediately if the isolated fiber has already terminated. Re-raises unhandled exceptions raised by the fiber.

The YAML module provides serialization and deserialization of YAML version 1.1 to/from native Crystal data structures, with the additional independent types specified in http://yaml.org/type/

NOTE To use YAML, you must explicitly import it with require "yaml"

YAML.parse will return an Any, which is a convenient wrapper around all possible YAML core types, making it easy to traverse a complex YAML structure but requires some casts from time to time, mostly via some method invocations.

YAML.parse can read from an IO directly (such as a file) which saves allocating a string:

A type T can be deserialized from YAML by invoking T.from_yaml(string_or_io). For this to work, T must implement new(ctx : YAML::PullParser, node : YAML::Nodes::Node) and decode a value from the given node, using ctx to store and retrieve anchored values (see YAML::PullParser for an explanation of this).

Crystal primitive types, Time, Bytes and Union implement this method. YAML::Serializable can be used to implement this method for user types.

YAML.dump generates the YAML representation for an object. An IO can be passed and it will be written there, otherwise it will be returned as a string. Similarly, #to_yaml (with or without an IO) on any object does the same.

For this to work, the type given to YAML.dump must implement to_yaml(builder : YAML::Nodes::Builder).

Crystal primitive types, Time and Bytes implement this method. YAML::Serializable can be used to implement this method for user types.

## Blocks and Procs¶

**URL:** https://crystal-lang.org/reference/1.18/syntax_and_semantics/blocks_and_procs.html

**Contents:**
- Blocks and Procs¶
- Overloads¶
- Yield arguments¶
- Short one-parameter syntax¶
- yield value¶
- Type restrictions¶
- break¶
- next¶
- with ... yield¶
- Unpacking block parameters¶

Methods can accept a block of code that is executed with the yield keyword. For example:

The above program prints "Hello!" twice, once for each yield.

To define a method that receives a block, simply use yield inside it and the compiler will know. You can make this more evident by declaring a dummy block parameter, indicated as a last parameter prefixed with ampersand (&). In the example above we did this, making the argument anonymous (writing just the &). But it can be given a name:

The block parameter name is irrelevant in this example, but will be relevant in more advanced uses.

To invoke a method and pass a block, you use do ... end or { ... }. All of these are equivalent:

The difference between using do ... end and { ... } is that do ... end binds to the left-most call, while { ... } binds to the right-most call:

The reason for this is to allow creating Domain Specific Languages (DSLs) using do ... end to have them be read as plain English:

You wouldn't want the above to be:

Two methods, one that yields and another that doesn't, are considered different overloads, as explained in the overloading section.

The yield expression is similar to a call and can receive arguments. For example:

The above prints "Got 1" and "Got 2".

A curly braces notation is also available:

You can yield many values:

A block can specify fewer parameters than the arguments yielded:

It's an error specifying more block parameters than the arguments yielded:

Each block parameter has the type of every yield expression in that position. For example:

The underscore is also allowed as a block parameter:

If a block has a single parameter and invokes a method on it, the block can be replaced with the short syntax argument.

can both be written as:

In either case, &.some_method is an argument passed to method. This argument is syntactically equivalent to the block variants. It is only syntactic sugar and does not have any performance penalty.

If the method has other required arguments, the short syntax argument should also be supplied in the method's argument list.

Arguments can be used with the short syntax argument as well:

Operators can be invoked too:

The yield expression itself has a value: the last expression of the block. For example:

The above prints "2" and "3".

A yield expression's value is mostly useful for transforming and filtering values. The best examples of this are Enumerable#map and Enumerable#select:

A dummy transformation method:

The result of the last expression is 2 because the last expression of the transform method is yield, whose value is the last expression of the block.

The type of the block in a method that uses yield can be restricted using the &block syntax. For example:

A break expression inside a block exits early from the method:

The above prints "Before 1" and "Before 2". The thrice method didn't execute the puts "Before 3" expression because of the break.

break can also accept arguments: these become the method's return value. For example:

The first call's value is 3 because the last expression of the twice method is yield, which gets the value of the block. The second call's value is "hello" because a break was performed.

If there are conditional breaks, the call's return value type will be a union of the type of the block's value and the type of the many breaks:

If a break receives many arguments, they are automatically transformed to a Tuple:

If a break receives no arguments, it's the same as receiving a single nil argument:

If a break is used within more than one nested block, only the immediate enclosing block is broken out of:

Notice you do not get two "after yield" nor an "end foo2".

The next expression inside a block exits early from the block (not the method). For example:

The next expression accepts arguments, and these give the value of the yield expression that invoked the block:

If a next receives many arguments, they are automatically transformed to a Tuple. If it receives no arguments it's the same as receiving a single nil argument.

A yield expression can be modified, using the with keyword, to specify an object to use as the default receiver of method calls within the block:

A block parameter can specify sub-parameters enclosed in parentheses:

The above is simply syntax sugar of this:

That means that any type that responds to [] with integers can be unpacked in a block parameter.

Parameter unpacking can be nested.

Splat parameters are supported.

For Tuple parameters you can take advantage of auto-splatting and do not need parentheses:

Hash(K, V)#each passes Tuple(K, V) to the block so iterating key-value pairs works with auto-splatting:

When using blocks with yield, the blocks are always inlined: no closures, calls or function pointers are involved. This means that this:

is exactly the same as writing this:

For example, the standard library includes a times method on integers, allowing you to write:

This looks very fancy, but is it as fast as a C for loop? The answer is: yes!

This is Int#times definition:

Because a non-captured block is always inlined, the above method invocation is exactly the same as writing this:

Have no fear using blocks for readability or code reuse, it won't affect the resulting executable performance.

**Examples:**

Example 1 (python):
```python
def twice(&)
  yield
  yield
end

twice do
  puts "Hello!"
end
```

Example 2 (python):
```python
def twice(&block)
  yield
  yield
end
```

Example 3 (julia):
```julia
twice() do
  puts "Hello!"
end

twice do
  puts "Hello!"
end

twice { puts "Hello!" }
```

Example 4 (markdown):
```markdown
foo bar do
  something
end

# The above is the same as
foo(bar) do
  something
end

foo bar { something }

# The above is the same as

foo(bar { something })
```

Tells a blocking run loop to no longer wait for events to activate.

Suspend the current fiber for duration.

Creates an event loop instance

Removes the file descriptor from the event loop. Can be used to free up memory resources associated with the file descriptor, as well as removing the file descriptor from kernel data structures.

Called by ::IO::FileDescriptor#finalize before closing the file descriptor. Errors shall be silently ignored.

Removes the socket from the event loop. Can be used to free up memory resources associated with the socket, as well as removing the socket from kernel data structures.

Called by ::Socket#finalize before closing the socket. Errors shall be silently ignored.

Create a new resume event for a fiber.

Creates a timeout_event.

Tells a blocking run loop to no longer wait for events to activate. It may for example enqueue a NOOP event with an immediate (or past) timeout. Having activated an event, the loop shall return, allowing the blocked thread to continue.

Should be a NOOP when the loop isn't running or is running in a nonblocking mode.

NOTE we assume that multiple threads won't run the event loop at the same time in parallel, but this assumption may change in the future!

Returns immediately if events are activable. Set blocking to false to return immediately if there are no activable events; set it to true to wait for activable events, which will block the current thread until then.

Returns true on normal returns (e.g. has activated events, has pending events but blocking was false) and false when there are no registered events.

Suspend the current fiber for duration.

Sets the element at the given index to value, without doing any bounds check.

Indexable::Mutable makes sure to invoke this method with index in 0...size, so converting negative indices to positive ones is not needed here.

Clients never invoke this method directly. Instead, they modify elements with #[]=(index, value).

This method should only be directly invoked if you are absolutely sure the index is in bounds, to avoid a bounds check for a small boost of performance.

Sorts all elements in self based on the return value of the comparison method T#<=> (see Comparable#<=>), using an unstable sort algorithm.

This sort operation modifies self. See #unstable_sort for a non-modifying option that allocates a new instance.

See Slice#unstable_sort! for details on the implementation.

Raises ArgumentError if the comparison between any two elements returns nil.

Sorts all elements in self based on the comparator in the given block, using an unstable sort algorithm.

The block must implement a comparison between two elements a and b, where a < b returns -1, a == b returns 0, and a > b returns 1. The comparison operator <=> can be used for this.

This sort operation modifies self. See #unstable_sort(&block : T, T -> U) for a non-modifying option that allocates a new instance.

See Slice#unstable_sort!(&block : T, T -> U) for details on the implementation.

Raises ArgumentError if for any two elements the block returns nil.

Sorts all elements in self by the output value of the block. The output values are compared via the comparison method #<=> (see Comparable#<=>), using an unstable sort algorithm.

This sort operation modifies self. See #unstable_sort_by(&block : T -> _) for a non-modifying option that allocates a new instance.

If stability is necessary, use #sort_by!(&block : T -> _) instead.

See #unstable_sort!(&block : T -> _) for details on the sorting mechanism.

Raises ArgumentError if the comparison between any two comparison values returns nil.

Yields the current element at the given index and updates the value at that index with the block's value. Returns the new value.

Raises IndexError if trying to set an element outside the container's range.

**Examples:**

Example 1 (javascript):
```javascript
ary = [1, 2, 3]
ary[0] = 5
ary # => [5, 2, 3]

ary[3] = 5 # raises IndexError
```

Example 2 (javascript):
```javascript
array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
array.fill(9, 2, 2) # => [1, 2, 9, 9, 5]
array               # => [1, 2, 9, 9, 5]
```

Example 3 (javascript):
```javascript
array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
array.fill(9, 2..3) # => [1, 2, 9, 9, 5]
array               # => [1, 2, 9, 9, 5]
```

Example 4 (javascript):
```javascript
array = [1, 2, 3, 4]
array.fill(2) # => [2, 2, 2, 2]
array         # => [2, 2, 2, 2]
```

For everything else this uses the defaults of your OpenSSL. Use this only if undoing the defaults that .new sets is too much hassle.

Generates a new TLS client context with sane defaults for a client connection.

Defaults to TLS_method or SSLv23_method (depending on OpenSSL version) which tells OpenSSL to negotiate the TLS or SSL protocol with the remote endpoint.

Don't change the method unless you must restrict a specific protocol to be used (eg: TLSv1.2) and nothing else. You should specify options to disable specific protocols, yet allow to negotiate from various other ones. For example the following snippet will enable the TLSv1, TLSv1.1 and TLSv1.2 protocols but disable the deprecated SSLv2 and SSLv3 protocols:

**Examples:**

Example 1 (javascript):
```javascript
require "openssl"

context = OpenSSL::SSL::Context::Client.from_hash({"key" => "private.key", "cert" => "certificate.crt", "ca" => "ca.pem"})

## Type restrictions¶

**URL:** https://crystal-lang.org/reference/1.18/syntax_and_semantics/type_restrictions.html

**Contents:**
- Type restrictions¶
- Restrictions from instance variables¶
- self restriction¶
- Classes as restrictions¶
- Type restrictions in splats¶
- Free variables¶
- Splat type restrictions¶

Type restrictions are applied to method parameters to restrict the types accepted by that method.

Note that if we had defined add without type restrictions, we would also have gotten a compile time error:

The above code gives this compile error:

This is because when you invoke add, it is instantiated with the types of the arguments: every method invocation with a different type combination results in a different method instantiation.

The only difference is that the first error message is a little more clear, but both definitions are safe in that you will get a compile time error anyway. So, in general, it's preferable not to specify type restrictions and almost only use them to define different method overloads. This results in more generic, reusable code. For example, if we define a class that has a + method but isn't a Number, we can use the add method that doesn't have type restrictions, but we can't use the add method that has restrictions.

Refer to the type grammar for the notation used in type restrictions.

Note that type restrictions do not apply to the variables inside the actual methods.

In some cases it is possible to restrict the type of a method's parameter based on its usage. For instance, consider the following example:

In this case we know that the parameter x from the initialization function must be an Int64, and there is no point in leave it unrestricted.

When the compiler finds an assignment from a method parameter to an instance variable, then it inserts such a restriction. In the example above, calling Foo.new "hi" fails with (note the type restriction):

A special type restriction is self:

In the previous example self is the same as writing Person. But, in general, self is the same as writing the type that will finally own that method, which, when modules are involved, becomes more useful.

As a side note, since Person inherits Reference the second definition of == is not needed, since it's already defined in Reference.

Note that self always represents a match against an instance type, even in class methods:

You can use self.class to restrict to the Person type. The next section talks about the .class suffix in type restrictions.

Using, for example, Int32 as a type restriction makes the method only accept instances of Int32:

If you want a method to only accept the type Int32 (not instances of it), you use .class:

The above is useful for providing overloads based on types, not instances:

You can specify type restrictions in splats:

When specifying a type, all elements in a tuple must match that type. Additionally, the empty-tuple doesn't match any of the above cases. If you want to support the empty-tuple case, add another overload:

A simple way to match against one or more elements of any type is to use _ as a restriction:

You can make a type restriction take the type of an argument, or part of the type of an argument, using forall:

That is, T becomes the type that was effectively used to instantiate the method.

A free variable can be used to extract the type argument of a generic type within a type restriction:

To create a method that accepts a type name, rather than an instance of a type, append .class to a free variable in the type restriction:

Multiple free variables can be specified too, for matching types of multiple arguments:

If a splat parameter's restriction also has a splat, the restriction must name a Tuple type, and the arguments corresponding to the parameter must match the elements of the splat restriction:

It is extremely rare to specify a tuple type in a splat restriction directly, since the above can be expressed by simply not using a splat (i.e. def foo(x : Int32, y : String). However, if the restriction is a free variable instead, then it is inferred to be a Tuple containing the types of all corresponding arguments:

On the last line, T is inferred to be the empty tuple, which is not possible for a splat parameter having a non-splat restriction.

Double splat parameters similarly support double splat type restrictions:

Additionally, single splat restrictions may be used inside a generic type as well, to extract multiple type arguments at once:

**Examples:**

Example 1 (python):
```python
def add(x : Number, y : Number)
  x + y
end

# Ok
add 1, 2

# Error: no overload matches 'add' with types Bool, Bool
add true, false
```

Example 2 (python):
```python
def add(x, y)
  x + y
end

add true, false
```

Example 3 (json):
```json
Error in foo.cr:6: instantiating 'add(Bool, Bool)'

add true, false
^~~

in foo.cr:2: undefined method '+' for Bool

  x + y
    ^
```

Example 4 (php):
```php
# A class that has a + method but isn't a Number
class Six
  def +(other)
    6 + other
  end
end

# add method without type restrictions
def add(x, y)
  x + y
end

# OK
add Six.new, 10

# add method with type restrictions
def restricted_add(x : Number, y : Number)
  x + y
end

# Error: no overload matches 'restricted_add' with types Six, Int32
restricted_add Six.new, 10
```

## Assignment¶

  - One-to-many assignment¶

- Underscore¶

An assignment expression assigns a value to a named identifier (usually a variable). The assignment operator is the equals sign (=).

The target of an assignment can be:

A method ending with an equals sign (=) is called a setter method. It can be used as the target of an assignment. The semantics of the assignment operator apply as a form of syntax sugar to the method call.

Calling setter methods requires an explicit receiver. The receiver-less syntax x = y is always parsed as an assignment to a local variable, never a call to a method x=. Even adding parentheses does not force a method call, as it would when reading from a local variable.

The following example shows two calls to a setter method in typical method notation and with assignment operator. Both assignment expressions are equivalent.

The following example shows two calls to an indexed assignment method in typical method notation and with index assignment operator. Both assignment expressions are equivalent.

Combined assignments are a combination of an assignment operator and another operator. This works with any target type except constants.

Some syntax sugar that contains the = character is available:

This assumes that the corresponding target local is assignable, either as a variable or via the respective getter and setter methods.

The = operator syntax sugar is also available to setter and index assignment methods. Note that || and && use the []? method to check for key presence.

The same value can be assigned to multiple targets using chained assignment. This works with any target type except constants.

You can declare/assign multiple variables at the same time by separating expressions with a comma (,). This works with any target type except constants.

Note that because expressions are assigned to temporary variables it is possible to exchange variables’ contents in a single line:

Multiple assignment is also available to methods that end with =:

And it is also available to index assignments ([]=):

If the right-hand side contains just one expression, the type is indexed for each variable on the left-hand side like so:

Additionally, if the strict_multi_assign flag is provided, the number of elements must match the number of targets, and the right-hand side must be an Indexable:

The left-hand side of an assignment may contain one splat, which collects any values not assigned to the other targets. A range index is used if the right-hand side has one expression:

Negative indices are used for targets after the splat:

If the expression does not have enough elements and the splat appears in the middle of the targets, IndexError is raised:

The right-hand side expression must be an Indexable. Both the size check and the Indexable check occur even without the strict_multi_assign flag (see One-to-many assignment above).

A Tuple is formed if there are multiple values:

The underscore can appear on the left-hand side of any assignment. Assigning a value to it has no effect and the underscore cannot be read from:

It is useful in multiple assignment when some of the values returned by the right-hand side are unimportant:

Assignments to *_ are dropped altogether, so multiple assignments can be used to extract the first and last elements in a value efficiently, without creating an intermediate object for the elements in the middle:

**Examples:**

Example 1 (php):
```php
# Assigns to a local variable
local = 1

# Assigns to an instance variable
@instance = 2

# Assigns to a class variable
@@class = 3

# Assigns to a constant
CONST = 4

# Assigns to a setter method
foo.method = 5
foo[0] = 6
```

Example 2 (php):
```php
class Thing
  def name=(value); end
end

thing = Thing.new

thing.name=("John")
thing.name = "John"
```

Example 3 (php):
```php
class List
  def []=(key, value); end
end

list = List.new

list.[]=(2, 3)
list[2] = 3
```

Example 4 (typescript):
```typescript
local += 1  # same as: local = local + 1
```

This class allows you to consume JSON on demand, token by token.

Each read_* method consumes the next token. Sometimes it consumes only one token (like #read_begin_array), sometimes it consumes a full valid value (like #read_array).

You must be careful when calling those methods, as they move forward into the JSON input you are pulling. Calling #read_string twice will return the next two strings (if possible), not twice the same.

If you try to read a token which is not the one currently under the cursor location, an exception ParseException will be raised.

If the value is not an integer or does not fit in a Float64 variable, it returns nil. If the value was actually an integer, it is converted to a float.

Reads a String value and returns it.

If the value is not a String, returns nil.

It reads the beginning of the array, yield each value of the array, and reads the end of the array. You have to consumes the values, if any, so the pull parser does not fail when reading the end of the array.

Reads the next lexer's token.

Contrary to #read_raw, it does not read a full value. For example if the next token is the beginning of an array, it will stop there, while #read_raw would have read the whole array.

Reads a null value and returns it.

Reads the current token if its value is null.

Returns true if the token was read.

Reads a null value and returns it, or executes the given block if the value is not null.

Reads a whole object.

It reads the beginning of the object, yield each key and key location, and reads the end of the object. You have to consumes the values, if any, so the pull parser does not fail when reading the end of the object.

Reads the new value and fill the a JSON builder with it.

Use this method with a JSON::Builder to read a JSON while building another one.

Read the next value and returns it.

The value is returned as a json string. If the value is an array or an object, it returns a string representing the full value. If the value in unknown, it raises a ParseException.

Reads a string and returns it.

Reads a string or a null value, and returns it.

Skips the next value.

It skips the whole value, not only the next lexer's token. For example if the next value is an array, the whole array will be skipped.

## Structs¶

**URL:** https://crystal-lang.org/reference/1.18/syntax_and_semantics/structs.html

**Contents:**
- Structs¶
- Passing by value¶
- Inheritance¶
- Records¶

Instead of defining a type with class you can do so with struct:

Structs inherit from Value so they are allocated on the stack and passed by value: when passed to methods, returned from methods or assigned to variables, a copy of the value is actually passed (while classes inherit from Reference, are allocated on the heap and passed by reference).

Therefore structs are mostly useful for immutable data types and/or stateless wrappers of other types, usually for performance reasons to avoid lots of small memory allocations when passing small copies might be more efficient (for more details, see the performance guide).

Mutable structs are still allowed, but you should be careful when writing code involving mutability if you want to avoid surprises that are described below.

A struct is always passed by value, even when you return self from the method of that struct:

Notice that the chained calls of plus return the expected result, but only the first call to it modifies the variable counter, as the second call operates on the copy of the struct passed to it from the first call, and this copy is discarded after the expression is executed.

You should also be careful when working on mutable types inside of the struct:

What happens with the strukt here:

Klass is a class, so it is passed by reference to modify, and object.array = ["new"] saves the reference to the newly created array in the original klass object, not in the copy as it was with the strukt.

The second point has a reason to it: a struct has a very well defined memory layout. For example, the above Point struct occupies 8 bytes. If you have an array of points the points are embedded inside the array's buffer:

If Point is inherited, an array of such type should also account for the fact that other types can be inside it, so the size of each element should grow to accommodate that. That is certainly unexpected. So, non-abstract structs can't be inherited from. Abstract structs, on the other hand, will have descendants, so it is expected that an array of them will account for the possibility of having multiple types inside it.

A struct can also include modules and can be generic, just like a class.

The Crystal Standard Library provides the record macro. It simplifies the definition of basic struct types with an initializer and some helper methods.

The record macro expands to the following struct definition:

**Examples:**

Example 1 (python):
```python
struct Point
  property x, y

  def initialize(@x : Int32, @y : Int32)
  end
end
```

Example 2 (python):
```python
struct Counter
  def initialize(@count : Int32)
  end

  def plus
    @count += 1
    self
  end
end

counter = Counter.new(0)
counter.plus.plus # => Counter(@count=2)
puts counter      # => Counter(@count=1)
```

Example 3 (julia):
```julia
class Klass
  property array = ["str"]
end

struct Strukt
  property array = ["str"]
end

def modify(object)
  object.array << "foo"
  object.array = ["new"]
  object.array << "bar"
end

klass = Klass.new
puts modify(klass) # => ["new", "bar"]
puts klass.array   # => ["new", "bar"]

strukt = Strukt.new
puts modify(strukt) # => ["new", "bar"]
puts strukt.array   # => ["str", "foo"]
```

Example 4 (markdown):
```markdown
# The array's buffer will have 8 bytes dedicated to each Point
ary = [] of Point
```

Creates a new parser which parses io with multipart boundary boundary.

True if #next can be called legally.

Parses the next form-data part and yields field name, io, FileMetadata, and raw headers.

This method yields once instead of returning the values, because the IO object yielded to the block is only valid while the block is executing. The IO object will be closed as soon as the block returns. To store the content of the body part for longer than the block, the IO must be read into memory.

```julia
require "http"

form_data = "--aA40\r\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\"field1\"; filename=\"foo.txt\"; size=13\r\nContent-Type: text/plain\r\n\r\nfield data\r\n--aA40--"

The reentrant protection maintains a lock count. Attempting to re-lock the mutex from the same fiber will increment the lock count. Attempting to unlock the counter from the same fiber will decrement the lock count, eventually releasing the lock when the lock count returns to 0. Attempting to unlock an unlocked mutex, or a mutex locked by another fiber will raise an exception.

You also disable all protections with unchecked. Attempting to re-lock the mutex from the same fiber will deadlock. Any fiber can unlock the mutex, even if it wasn't previously locked.

JSON::Any is a convenient wrapper around all possible JSON types (JSON::Any::Type) and can be used for traversing dynamic or unknown JSON structures.

Note that methods used to traverse a JSON structure, #[] and #[]?, always return a JSON::Any to allow further traversal. To convert them to String, Int32, etc., use the as_ methods, such as #as_s, #as_i, which perform a type check against the raw underlying value. This means that invoking #as_s when the underlying value is not a String will raise: the value won't automatically be converted (parsed) to a String. There are also nil-able variants (#as_i?, #as_s?, ...), which return nil when the underlying value type won't match.

It serves both to perform requests by an HTTP::Client and to represent requests received by an HTTP::Server.

HTTP::Server will try to fill this property, and its value will have a format like "IP:port", but this format is not guaranteed. Middlewares can overwrite this value.

This property is not used by HTTP::Client.

Returns the underlying URI object.

Used internally to provide the components of the request uri.

**Examples:**

Example 1 (julia):
```julia
class ForwarderHandler
  include HTTP::Handler

  def call(context)
    if ip = context.request.headers["X-Real-IP"]? # When using a reverse proxy that guarantees this field.
      context.request.remote_address = Socket::IPAddress.new(ip, 0)
    end
    call_next(context)
  end
end

server = HTTP::Server.new([ForwarderHandler.new, HTTP::LogHandler.new])
```

Example 2 (julia):
```julia
class ForwarderHandler
  include HTTP::Handler

  def call(context)
    if ip = context.request.headers["X-Real-IP"]? # When using a reverse proxy that guarantees this field.

A Slice is a Pointer with an associated size.

While a pointer is unsafe because no bound checks are performed when reading from and writing to it, reading from and writing to a slice involve bound checks. In this way, a slice is a safe alternative to Pointer.

A Slice can be created as read-only: trying to write to it will raise. For example the slice of bytes returned by String#to_slice is read-only.

Returns the additive identity of this type.

Creates an empty slice.

Returns a new slice that has the elements from slices joined together.

Creates a slice to the given pointer, bounded by the given size.

Constructs a read-only Slice constant from the given args. The slice contents are stored in the program's read-only data section.

If T is specified, it must be one of the Number::Primitive types and cannot be a union. The args must all be number literals that fit into T's range, as if they are autocasted into T.

If T is not specified, it is inferred from args, which must all be number literals of the same type, and cannot be empty.

EXPERIMENTAL Slice literals are still under development. Join the discussion at #2886.

Creates a new Slice with the given args. The type of the slice will be the union of the type of the given args.

The slice is allocated on the heap.

If T is a Number then this is equivalent to Number.slice (numbers will be coerced to the type T)

Returns a new slice that is offset elements apart from this slice.

Returns a new slice that has self's elements followed by other's elements.

See also: Slice.join to join multiple slices at once without creating intermediate results.

Combined comparison operator.

Returns a negative number, 0, or a positive number depending on whether self is less than other, equals other.

It compares the elements of both slices in the same position using the <=> operator. As soon as one of such comparisons returns a non-zero value, that result is the return value of the comparison.

If all elements are equal, the comparison is based on the size of the arrays.

Returns true if self and other have the same size and all their elements are equal, false otherwise.

Returns a new slice that starts at start elements from this slice's start, and of exactly count size.

Negative start is added to #size, thus it's treated as index counting from the end of the array, -1 designating the last element.

Raises ArgumentError if count is negative. Raises IndexError if the new slice falls outside this slice.

Returns a new slice with the elements in the given range.

The first element in the returned slice is self[range.begin] followed by the next elements up to index range.end (or self[range.end - 1] if the range is exclusive). If there are fewer elements in self, the returned slice is shorter than range.size.

Negative indices count backward from the end of the slice (-1 is the last element). Additionally, an empty slice is returned when the starting index for an element range is at the end of the slice.

Raises IndexError if the new slice falls outside this slice.

Raises ArgumentError if for any two elements the block returns nil.

Sorts all elements in self based on the return value of the comparison method T#<=> (see Comparable#<=>), using a stable sort algorithm.

This sort operation modifies self. See #sort for a non-modifying option that allocates a new instance.

The sort mechanism is implemented as merge sort. It is stable, which is typically a good default.

Stability means that two elements which compare equal (i.e. a <=> b == 0) keep their original relation. Stable sort guarantees that [a, b].sort! always results in [a, b] (given they compare equal). With unstable sort, the result could also be [b, a].

If stability is expendable, #unstable_sort! provides a performance advantage over stable sort. As an optimization, if T is any primitive integer type, Char, any enum type, any Pointer instance, Symbol, or Time::Span, then an unstable sort is automatically used.

Raises ArgumentError if the comparison between any two elements returns nil.

Sorts all elements in self based on the comparator in the given block, using a stable sort algorithm.

The block must implement a comparison between two elements a and b, where a < b outputs a negative value, a == b outputs 0, and a > b outputs a positive value. The comparison operator (Comparable#<=>) can be used for this.

The block's output type must be <= Int32?, but returning an actual nil value is an error.

Returns a new Bytes pointing at the same contents as self.

WARNING This method is unsafe: the returned slice is writable if self is also writable, and modifications through the returned slice may violate the binary representations of Crystal objects. Additionally, the same elements may produce different results depending on the system endianness.

Returns the element at the given index, without doing any bounds check.

Indexable makes sure to invoke this method with index in 0...size, so converting negative indices to positive ones is not needed here.

Clients never invoke this method directly. Instead, they access elements with #[](index) and #[]?(index).

This method should only be directly invoked if you are absolutely sure the index is in bounds, to avoid a bounds check for a small boost of performance.

Sets the element at the given index to value, without doing any bounds check.

This method should only be directly invoked if you are absolutely sure the index is in bounds, to avoid a bounds check for a small boost of performance.

Returns a new Slice pointing at the same contents as self, but reinterpreted as elements of the given type.

The returned slice never refers to more memory than self; if the last bytes of self do not fit into a U, they are excluded from the returned slice.

WARNING This method is unsafe: elements are reinterpreted using #unsafe_as, and the resulting slice may not be properly aligned. Additionally, the same elements may produce different results depending on the system endianness.

## Closures¶

**URL:** https://crystal-lang.org/reference/1.18/syntax_and_semantics/closures.html

**Contents:**
- Closures¶
- Type of closured variables¶

Captured blocks and proc literals closure local variables and self. This is better understood with an example:

Or with a proc returned from a method:

In the above example, even though x is a local variable, it was captured by the proc literal. In this case the compiler allocates x on the heap and uses it as the context data of the proc to make it work, because normally local variables live in the stack and are gone after a method returns.

The compiler is usually moderately smart about the type of local variables. For example:

The compiler knows that after the block, x can be Int32 or String (it could know that it will always be String because the method always yields; this may improve in the future).

If x is assigned something else after the block, the compiler knows the type changed:

However, if x is closured by a proc, the type is always the mixed type of all assignments to it:

This is because the captured block could have been potentially stored in a class or instance variable and invoked in a separate thread in between the instructions. The compiler doesn't do an exhaustive analysis of this: it just assumes that if a variable is captured by a proc, the time of that proc invocation is unknown.

This also happens with regular proc literals, even if it's evident that the proc wasn't invoked or stored:

**Examples:**

Example 1 (javascript):
```javascript
x = 0
proc = -> { x += 1; x }
proc.call # => 1
proc.call # => 2
x         # => 2
```

Example 2 (javascript):
```javascript
def counter
  x = 0
  -> { x += 1; x }
end

proc = counter
proc.call # => 1
proc.call # => 2
```

Example 3 (python):
```python
def foo(&)
  yield
end

x = 1
foo do
  x = "hello"
end
x # : Int32 | String
```

Example 4 (csharp):
```csharp
x = 1
foo do
  x = "hello"
end
x # : Int32 | String

x = 'a'
x # : Char
```

type must be a primitive integer type. Raises YAML::ParseException if node is not a valid integer or its value is outside type's range.

Returns true if node parses to a null value.

If node parses to a null value, returns nil, otherwise invokes the given block.

Assuming the pull_parser is positioned in a scalar, parses it according to the core schema, taking the scalar's style and tag into account, then advances the pull parser.

Parses a string according to the core schema, assuming the string had a plain style.

Parses a scalar value from the given node.

Returns whether a string is reserved and must non be output with a plain style, according to the core schema.

**Examples:**

Example 1 (yaml):
```yaml
require "yaml"

YAML::Schema::Core.parse_scalar("hello") # => "hello"
YAML::Schema::Core.parse_scalar("1.2")   # => 1.2
YAML::Schema::Core.parse_scalar("false") # => false
```

Example 2 (yaml):
```yaml
require "yaml"

YAML::Schema::Core.reserved_string?("hello") # => false
YAML::Schema::Core.reserved_string?("1.2")   # => true
YAML::Schema::Core.reserved_string?("false") # => true
```

Expectations are used by Spec::ObjectExtensions#should and Spec::ObjectExtensions#should_not.

Creates an Expectation that passes if actual is of type type (is_a?).

Creates an Expectation that passes if actual and value are identical (.same?).

Returns a factory to create a comparison Expectation that:

Creates an Expectation that passes if actual is within delta of expected.

Creates an Expectation that passes if actual is empty (.empty?).

Creates an Expectation that passes if actual is false (== false).

Creates an Expectation that passes if actual is falsy (nil or false).

Creates an Expectation that passes if actual is nil (Object#nil?).

Creates an Expectation that passes if actual is true (== true).

Creates an Expectation that passes if actual is truthy (neither nil nor false).

Creates an Expectation that passes if actual includes expected (.includes?).

Creates an Expectation that passes if actual ends with expected (.ends_with?).

Creates an Expectation that passes if actual equals value (==).

Creates an Expectation that passes if actual matches value (=~).

Creates an Expectation that passes if actual starts with expected (.starts_with?).

A write-only IO object to compress data in the DEFLATE format.

Instances of this class wrap another IO object. When you write to this instance, it compresses the data and writes it to the underlying IO.

NOTE unless created with a block, #close must be invoked after all data has been written to a Flate::Writer instance.

Creates an instance of Flate::Writer.

Creates a new writer for the given io, yields it to the given block, and closes it at its end.

Returns true if this IO is closed.

Appends a String representation of this object which includes its class name, its object address and the values of all instance variables.

Always raises IO::Error because this is a write-only IO.

If #sync_close? is true, closing this IO will close the underlying IO.

If #sync_close? is true, closing this IO will close the underlying IO.

Creates an instance of Flate::Writer. #close must be invoked after all data has written.

Creates a new writer for the given io, yields it to the given block, and closes it at its end.

Closes this writer. Must be invoked after all data has been written.

Returns true if this IO is closed.

Appends a String representation of this object which includes its class name, its object address and the values of all instance variables.

Always raises IO::Error because this is a write-only IO.

If #sync_close? is true, closing this IO will close the underlying IO.

If #sync_close? is true, closing this IO will close the underlying IO.

**Examples:**

Example 1 (python):
```python
class Person
  def initialize(@name : String, @age : Int32)
  end
end

Person.new("John", 32).inspect # => #<Person:0x10fd31f20 @name="John", @age=32>

Closes the file descriptor resource.

Opens a file at path.

Opens an unidirectional pipe.

Reads at least one byte from the file descriptor into slice.

Hook to react on the file descriptor after it has been reopened.

Blocks the current fiber until the file descriptor is ready for read.

Blocks the current fiber until the file descriptor is ready for write.

Writes at least one byte from slice to the file descriptor.

Closes the file descriptor resource.

Opens a file at path.

Blocks the current fiber until the file has been opened. Avoids blocking the current thread if possible, especially when blocking is false or nil.

Returns the system file descriptor or handle, or a system error.

Opens an unidirectional pipe.

The implementation shall respect the specified blocking arguments for each end of the pipe, and follow its internal blocking requirements when a blocking arg is nil.

Returns a tuple with the reader and writer IO objects.

Reads at least one byte from the file descriptor into slice.

Blocks the current fiber if no data is available for reading, continuing when available. Otherwise returns immediately.

Returns the number of bytes read (up to slice.size). Returns 0 when EOF is reached.

Hook to react on the file descriptor after it has been reopened. For example we might want to resume all pending operations to act on the new file descriptor.

Blocks the current fiber until the file descriptor is ready for read.

Blocks the current fiber until the file descriptor is ready for write.

Writes at least one byte from slice to the file descriptor.

Blocks the current fiber if the file descriptor isn't ready for writing, continuing when ready. Otherwise returns immediately.

Returns the number of bytes written (up to slice.size).

Reference is the base class of classes you define in your program. It is set as a class' superclass when you don't specify one:

A reference type is passed by reference: when you pass it to methods, return it from methods or assign it to variables, a pointer is actually passed.

Invoking .new on a Reference allocates a new instance on the heap. The instance's memory is automatically freed (garbage-collected) when the instance is no longer referred by any other entity in the program.

Constructs an object in-place at the given address, forwarding args and opts to #initialize.

EXPERIMENTAL This API is still under development. Join the discussion about custom reference allocation at #13481.

Performs basic initialization so that the given address is ready for use as an object's instance data.

EXPERIMENTAL This API is still under development. Join the discussion about custom reference allocation at #13481.

Returns true if this reference is the same as other.

Returns false (other can only be a Value here).

Returns a shallow copy of this object.

See Object#hash(hasher)

Appends a String representation of this object which includes its class name, its object address and the values of all instance variables.

Returns a UInt64 that uniquely identifies this object.

Returns true if this reference is the same as other.

Returns false: a reference is never nil.

Appends a short String representation of this object which includes its class name and its object address.

Constructs an object in-place at the given address, forwarding args and opts to #initialize. Returns that object.

This method can be used to decouple object allocation from initialization. For example, the instance data might come from a custom allocator, or it might reside on the stack using a type like ReferenceStorage.

address must point to a suitably aligned buffer of at least instance_sizeof(self) bytes.

WARNING This method is unsafe, as it assumes the caller is responsible for managing the memory at the given address manually.

See also: Reference.pre_initialize.

EXPERIMENTAL This API is still under development. Join the discussion about custom reference allocation at #13481.

Performs basic initialization so that the given address is ready for use as an object's instance data. Returns address cast to self's type.

More specifically, this is the part of object initialization that occurs after memory allocation and before calling one of the #initialize overloads. It zeroes the memory, sets up the type ID (necessary for dynamic dispatch), and then runs all inline instance variable initializers.

address must point to a buffer of at least instance_sizeof(self) bytes with an alignment of instance_alignof(self) or above. ReferenceStorage fulfils both requirements.

WARNING The caller is responsible for managing the memory at the given address, in particular if the memory is not garbage-collectable.

See also: Reference.unsafe_construct, Struct.pre_initialize.

EXPERIMENTAL This API is still under development. Join the discussion about custom reference allocation at #13481.

Returns true if this reference is the same as other. Invokes #same?.

Returns false (other can only be a Value here).

Returns a shallow copy of this object.

This allocates a new object and copies the contents of self into it.

See Object#hash(hasher)

Appends a String representation of this object which includes its class name, its object address and the values of all instance variables.

Returns a UInt64 that uniquely identifies this object.

The returned value is the memory address of this object.

Returns true if this reference is the same as other. This is only true if this reference's #object_id is the same as other's.

Returns false: a reference is never nil.

Appends a short String representation of this object which includes its class name and its object address.

A named tuple is a fixed-size, immutable, stack-allocated mapping of a fixed set of keys to values.

You can think of a NamedTuple as an immutable Hash whose keys (which are of type Symbol), and the types for each key, are known at compile time.

A named tuple can be created with a named tuple literal:

See NamedTuple literals in the language reference.

The compiler knows what types are in each key, so when indexing a named tuple with a symbol or string literal the compiler will return the value for that key and with the expected type, like in the above snippet. Indexing with a symbol or string literal for which there's no key will give a compile-time error.

Indexing with a symbol or string that is only known at runtime will return a value whose type is the union of all the types in the named tuple, and might raise KeyError.

Indexing with #[]? does not make the return value nilable if the key is known to exist:

NamedTuple's own instance classes may also be indexed in a similar manner, returning their value types instead:

## as¶

**Contents:**
- as¶
- Converting between pointer types¶
- Converting between pointer types and other types¶
- Usage for casting to a bigger type¶
- Usage for when the compiler can't infer the type of a block¶

The as pseudo-method restricts the types of an expression. For example:

In the above code, a is a union of Int32 | String. If for some reason we are sure a is an Int32 after the if, we can force the compiler to treat it like one:

The as pseudo-method performs a runtime check: if a wasn't an Int32, an exception is raised.

The argument to the expression is a type.

If it is impossible for a type to be restricted by another type, a compile-time error is issued:

You can't use as to convert a type to an unrelated type: as is not like a cast in other languages. Methods on integers, floats and chars are provided for these conversions. Alternatively, use pointer casts as explained below.

The as pseudo-method also allows to cast between pointer types:

In this case, no runtime checks are done: pointers are unsafe and this type of casting is usually only needed in C bindings and low-level code.

Conversion between pointer types and Reference types is also possible:

No runtime checks are performed in these cases because, again, pointers are involved. The need for this cast is even more rare than the previous one, but allows to implement some core types (like String) in Crystal itself, and it also allows passing a Reference type to C functions by casting it to a void pointer.

The as pseudo-method can be used to cast an expression to a "bigger" type. For example:

The above might not seem to be useful, but it is when, for example, mapping an array of elements:

The Array#map method uses the block's type as the generic type for the Array. Without the as pseudo-method, the inferred type would have been Int32 and we wouldn't have been able to add a Float64 into it.

Sometimes the compiler can't infer the type of a block. This can happen in recursive calls that depend on each other. In those cases you can use as to let it know the type:

**Examples:**

Example 1 (markdown):
```markdown
if some_condition
  a = 1
else
  a = "hello"
end

# a : Int32 | String
```

Example 2 (unknown):
```unknown
a_as_int = a.as(Int32)
a_as_int.abs # works, compiler knows that a_as_int is Int32
```

Example 3 (unknown):
```unknown
1.as(String) # Compile-time error
```

Example 4 (julia):
```julia
ptr = Pointer(Int32).malloc(1)
ptr.as(Int8*) # :: Pointer(Int8)
```

**Contents:**
- alias¶

With alias you can give a type a different name:

Every time you use an alias the compiler replaces it with the type it refers to.

Aliases are useful to avoid writing long type names, but also to be able to talk about recursive types:

A real-world example of a recursive type is json:

**Examples:**

Example 1 (unknown):
```unknown
alias PInt32 = Pointer(Int32)

ptr = PInt32.malloc(1) # : Pointer(Int32)
```

Example 2 (javascript):
```javascript
alias RecArray = Array(Int32) | Array(RecArray)

ary = [] of RecArray
ary.push [1, 2, 3]
ary.push ary
ary # => [[1, 2, 3], [...]]
```

Example 3 (julia):
```julia
module Json
  alias Type = Nil |
               Bool |
               Int64 |
               Float64 |
               String |

An alias declaration inside a lib declares a C typedef:

Now Int32 and MyInt are interchangeable:

An alias is most useful to avoid writing long types over and over, but also to declare a type based on compile-time flags:

Refer to the type grammar for the notation used in alias types.

**Examples:**

Example 1 (julia):
```julia
lib X
  alias MyInt = Int32
end
```

Example 2 (julia):
```julia
lib X
  alias MyInt = Int32

  fun some_fun(value : MyInt)
end

X.some_fun 1 # OK
```

Example 3 (julia):
```julia
lib C
  {% if flag?(:x86_64) %}

  {% else %}
    alias SizeT = Int32

A BigFloat can represent arbitrarily large floats.

It is implemented under the hood with GMP.

NOTE To use BigFloat, you must explicitly import it with require "big"

Negates this value's sign.

The comparison operator.

Returns the absolute value of this number.

Rounds towards positive infinity.

Rounds towards negative infinity.

Prints this number as a String using a customizable format.

Checks whether this value is infinite.

Returns true if self is an integer.

Returns whether this value is a not-a-number.

Rounds towards the nearest integer.

Rounds towards the nearest integer.

Returns a BigInt representing this float (rounded using #floor).

Prints a nicely readable and concise string representation of this object, typically intended for users, to io.

Negates this value's sign.

The comparison operator. Returns 0 if the two objects are equal, a negative number if this object is considered less than other, a positive number if this object is considered greater than other, or nil if the two objects are not comparable.

Subclasses define this method to provide class-specific ordering.

The comparison operator is usually used to sort values:

Returns the absolute value of this number.

Rounds towards positive infinity.

Rounds towards negative infinity.

Prints this number as a String using a customizable format.

separator is used as decimal separator, delimiter as thousands delimiter between batches of group digits.

If decimal_places is nil, all significant decimal places are printed (similar to #to_s). If the argument has a numeric value, the number of visible decimal places will be fixed to that amount.

Trailing zeros are omitted if only_significant is true.

Checks whether this value is infinite. Returns 1 if this value is positive infinity, -1 if this value is negative infinity, or nil otherwise.

Returns true if self is an integer.

Non-integer types may return true as long as self denotes a finite value without any fractional parts.

Returns whether this value is a not-a-number.

This includes both quiet and signalling NaNs from IEEE 754.

Rounds towards the nearest integer. If both neighboring integers are equidistant, rounds away from zero.

Rounds towards the nearest integer. If both neighboring integers are equidistant, rounds towards the even neighbor (Banker's rounding).

Returns a BigInt representing this float (rounded using #floor).

Prints a nicely readable and concise string representation of this object, typically intended for users, to io.

This method is called when an object is interpolated in a string literal:

IO#<< calls this method to append an object to itself:

Thus implementations must not interpolate self in a string literal or call io << self which both would lead to an endless loop.

Also see #inspect(IO).

**Examples:**

Example 1 (json):
```json
# Sort in a descending way:
[3, 1, 2].sort { |x, y| y <=> x } # => [3, 2, 1]

# Sort in an ascending way:
[3, 1, 2].sort { |x, y| x <=> y } # => [1, 2, 3]
```

Example 2 (javascript):
```javascript
123.abs  # => 123
-123.abs # => 123
```

Example 3 (javascript):
```javascript
123_456.789.format                                            # => "123,456.789"
123_456.789.format(',', '.')                                  # => "123.456,789"
123_456.789.format(decimal_places: 2)                         # => "123,456.79"
123_456.789.format(decimal_places: 6)                         # => "123,456.789000"
123_456.789.format(decimal_places: 6, only_significant: true) # => "123,456.789"
```

Example 4 (javascript):
```javascript
1.integer?       # => true
1.0.integer?     # => true
1.2.integer?     # => false
(1 / 0).integer? # => false

- module ECR
- Overview
- Defined in:
- Macro Summary
- Macro Detail

Embedded Crystal (ECR) is a template language for embedding Crystal code into other text, that includes but is not limited to HTML. The template is read and transformed at compile time and then embedded into the binary.

There are <%= %> and <% %> syntax. The former will render returned values. The latter will not, but instead serve to control the structure as we do in Crystal.

Using a dash inside <...> either eliminates previous indentation or removes the next newline:

A comment can be created the same as normal code: <% # hello %> or by the special tag: <%# hello %>. An ECR tag can be inserted directly (i.e. the tag itself may be escaped) by using a second % like so: <%% a = b %> or <%%= foo %>. Dashes may also be present in those escaped tags and have no effect on the surrounding text.

NOTE To use ECR, you must explicitly import it with require "ecr"

Create a simple ECR file named greeter.ecr:

and then use it like so with the #def_to_s macro:

Using logical statements:

Comments and Escapes:

Likewise, other Crystal logic can be implemented in ECR text.

Defines a to_s(io) method whose body is the ECR contained in filename, translated to Crystal code.

Embeds an ECR file filename into the program and appends the content to an IO in the variable io_name.

Embeds an ECR file filename into the program and renders it to a string.

Defines a to_s(io) method whose body is the ECR contained in filename, translated to Crystal code.

The macro basically translates the text inside the given file to Crystal code that appends to the IO:

Embeds an ECR file filename into the program and appends the content to an IO in the variable io_name.

The generated code is the result of translating the contents of the ECR file to Crystal, a program that appends to an IO.

The ECR.embed line basically generates this Crystal code:

Embeds an ECR file filename into the program and renders it to a string.

The generated code is the result of translating the contents of the ECR file to Crystal, a program that appends to an IO and returns a string.

The ECR.render basically generates this Crystal code:

**Examples:**

Example 1 (python):
```python
Greetings, <%= @name %>!
```

Example 2 (python):
```python
require "ecr"

class Greeter
  def initialize(@name : String)
  end

  ECR.def_to_s "greeter.ecr"
end

Greeter.new("John").to_s # => "Greetings, John!\n"
```

Example 3 (markdown):
```markdown
# greeter.ecr
<%- if @name -%>
Greetings, <%= @name %>!
<%- else -%>
Greetings!
<%- end -%>
```

Example 4 (python):
```python
require "ecr"

class Greeter
  def initialize(@name : String | Nil)
  end

  ECR.def_to_s "greeter.ecr"
end

Greeter.new(nil).to_s    # => "Greetings!\n"
Greeter.new("Jill").to_s # => "Greetings, Jill!\n"

The Nil type has only one possible value: nil.

nil is commonly used to represent the absence of a value. For example, String#index returns the position of the character or nil if it's not in the string:

In the above example, trying to invoke a method on the returned value will give a compile time error unless both Int32 and Nil define that method:

The language and the standard library provide short, readable, easy ways to deal with nil, such as Object#try and Object#not_nil!:

See Nil literal in the language reference.

Returns true: Nil has only one singleton value: nil.

See Object#hash(hasher)

Writes "nil" to the given IO.

Raises NilAssertionError.

Returns true: Nil has only one singleton value: nil.

Doesn't write anything to the given IO.

Returns an empty string.

Doesn't yield to the block.

Returns true: Nil has only one singleton value: nil.

See Object#hash(hasher)

Writes "nil" to the given IO.

Raises NilAssertionError.

If message is given, it is forwarded as error message of NilAssertionError.

See also: Object#not_nil!.

Returns 0_u64. Even though Nil is not a Reference type, it is usually mixed with them to form nilable types so it's useful to have an object id for nil.

Returns self. This method enables to call the #presence method (see String#presence) on a union with Nil. The idea is to return nil when the value is nil or empty.

Returns true: Nil has only one singleton value: nil.

Doesn't write anything to the given IO.

Returns an empty string.

Doesn't yield to the block.

See also: Object#try.

**Examples:**

Example 1 (javascript):
```javascript
str = "Hello world"
str.index 'e' # => 1
str.index 'a' # => nil
```

Example 2 (unknown):
```unknown
str = "Hello world"
idx = str.index 'e'
idx + 1 # Error: undefined method '+' for Nil
```

Example 3 (markdown):
```markdown
str = "Hello world"

# The index of 'e' in str or 0 if not found
idx1 = str.index('e') || 0

idx2 = str.index('a')
if idx2
  # Compiles: idx2 can't be nil here
  idx2 + 1
end

# Tell the compiler that we are sure the returned
# value is not nil: raises a runtime exception
# if our assumption doesn't hold.
idx3 = str.index('o').not_nil!
```

Example 4 (javascript):
```javascript
config = {"empty" => ""}
config["empty"]?.presence   # => nil
config["missing"]?.presence # => nil

Primitive types, except Void, are expected to not contain inner pointers. Proc and Pointer contain inner pointers. Unions, structs and collection types (tuples, static arrays) have inner pointers if any of their contained types has inner pointers. All other types, including classes, are expected to contain inner pointers.

Types that do not have inner pointers may opt to use atomic allocations, i.e. GC.malloc_atomic rather than GC.malloc. The compiler ensures that, for any type T:

Determines if self overrides any method named method from type type.

Return true if self is private and false otherwise.

Return true if self is public and false otherwise.

Returns self. This method exists so you can safely call #resolve on a node and resolve it to a type, even if it's a type already.

- Proc literal¶

A captured block is the same as declaring a Proc literal and passing it to the method.

As explained in the proc literals section, a Proc can also be created from existing methods:

**Examples:**

Example 1 (python):
```python
def some_proc(&block : Int32 -> Int32)
  block
end

x = 0
proc = ->(i : Int32) { x += i }
proc = some_proc(&proc)
proc.call(1)  # => 1
proc.call(10) # => 11
x             # => 11
```

Example 2 (python):
```python
def add(x, y)
  x + y
end

adder = ->add(Int32, Int32)
adder.call(1, 2) # => 3
```

A Proc represents a function pointer with an optional context (the closure data). It is typically created with a proc literal:

See Proc literals in the language reference.

The types of the arguments (T) are mandatory, except when directly sending a proc literal to a lib fun in C bindings.

The return type (R) is inferred from the proc's body.

A special new method is provided too:

This form allows you to specify the return type and to check it against the proc's body.

Another way to create a Proc is by capturing a block:

When capturing blocks, the type of the arguments and return type must be specified in the capturing method block signature.

Passing a Proc to a C function, for example as a callback, is possible as long as the Proc isn't a closure. If it is, either a compile-time or runtime error will happen depending on whether the compiler can check this. The reason is that a Proc is internally represented as two void pointers, one having the function pointer and another the closure data. If just the function pointer is passed, the closure data will be missing at invocation time.

Most of the time a C function that allows setting a callback also provide an argument for custom data. This custom data is then sent as an argument to the callback. For example, suppose a C function that invokes a callback at every tick, passing that tick:

To properly define a wrapper for this function we must send the Proc as the callback data, and then convert that callback data to the Proc and finally invoke it.

Note that we save the box in @@box. The reason is that if we don't do it, and our code doesn't reference it anymore, the GC will collect it. The C library will of course store the callback, but Crystal's GC has no way of knowing that.

Creates a Proc by capturing the given block.

Returns the number of arguments of this Proc.

Invokes this Proc and returns the result.

See Object#hash(hasher)

Returns a new Proc that has its first arguments fixed to the values given by args.

Prints a nicely readable and concise string representation of this object, typically intended for users, to io.

Creates a Proc by capturing the given block.

The block argument types are inferred from the Proc's type arguments. The return type of the block must match the return type specified in the Proc type.

The #=== method is used in a case ... when ... end expression.

For example, this code:

Is equivalent to this code:

Object simply implements #=== by invoking #==, but subclasses (notably Regex) can override it to provide meaningful case-equality semantics.

Returns the number of arguments of this Proc.

Invokes this Proc and returns the result.

See Object#hash(hasher)

Returns a new Proc that has its first arguments fixed to the values given by args.

See Wikipedia, Partial application

Prints a nicely readable and concise string representation of this object, typically intended for users, to io.

This method is called when an object is interpolated in a string literal:

IO#<< calls this method to append an object to itself:

Thus implementations must not interpolate self in a string literal or call io << self which both would lead to an endless loop.

Also see #inspect(IO).

**Examples:**

Example 1 (markdown):
```markdown
# A proc without arguments
-> { 1 } # Proc(Int32)

# A proc with one argument
->(x : Int32) { x.to_s } # Proc(Int32, String)

# A proc with two arguments:
->(x : Int32, y : Int32) { x + y } # Proc(Int32, Int32, Int32)
```

Example 2 (css):
```css
Proc(Int32, String).new { |x| x.to_s } # Proc(Int32, String)
```

Example 3 (python):
```python
def capture(&block : Int32 -> Int32)
  # block argument is used, so block is turned into a Proc
  block
end

proc = capture { |x| x + 1 } # Proc(Int32, Int32)
proc.call(1)                 # => 2
```

Example 4 (php):
```php
lib LibTicker
  fun on_tick(callback : (Int32, Void* ->), data : Void*)
end
```

Suspend execution until a collection of fibers are finished.

The wait group is a declarative counter of how many concurrent fibers have been started. Each such fiber is expected to call #done to report that they are finished doing their work. Whenever the counter reaches zero the waiters will be resumed.

This is a simpler and more efficient alternative to using a Channel(Nil) then looping a number of times until we received N messages to resume execution.

Yields a WaitGroup instance and waits at the end of the block for all of the work enqueued inside it to complete.

Increments the counter by how many fibers we want to wait for.

Decrements the counter by one.

Increment the counter by 1, perform the work inside the block in a separate fiber, decrementing the counter after it completes or raises.

Suspends the current fiber until the counter reaches zero, at which point the fiber will be resumed.

Yields a WaitGroup instance and waits at the end of the block for all of the work enqueued inside it to complete.

Increments the counter by how many fibers we want to wait for.

A negative value decrements the counter. When the counter reaches zero, all waiting fibers will be resumed. Raises RuntimeError if the counter reaches a negative value.

Can be called at any time, allowing concurrent fibers to add more fibers to wait for, but they must always do so before calling #done that would decrement the counter, to make sure that the counter may never inadvertently reach zero before all fibers are done.

Decrements the counter by one. Must be called by concurrent fibers once they have finished processing. When the counter reaches zero, all waiting fibers will be resumed.

Increment the counter by 1, perform the work inside the block in a separate fiber, decrementing the counter after it completes or raises. Returns the Fiber that was spawned.

Suspends the current fiber until the counter reaches zero, at which point the fiber will be resumed.

Can be called from different fibers.

Example 1 (markdown):
```markdown
require "wait_group"
wg = WaitGroup.new(5)

5.times do
  spawn do
    do_something

  end
end

# suspend the current fiber until the 5 fibers are done
wg.wait

A Box allows turning any object to a Void* and back.

A Box's purpose is passing data to C as a Void* and then converting that back to the original data type.

For an example usage, see Proc's explanation about sending Procs to C.

Turns object into a Void*.

Unboxes a Void* into an object of type T.

Turns object into a Void*.

If T is not a reference or pointer type, nor a union between reference types and Nil, this method effectively copies object to the dynamic heap.

NOTE The returned pointer might not be a null pointer even when object is nil.

Unboxes a Void* into an object of type T. Note that for this you must specify T: Box(T).unbox(data).

WARNING It is undefined behavior to box an object in one type and unbox it via a different type; in particular, when boxing a T and unboxing it as a T?, or vice-versa.

Object is the base type of all Crystal objects.

Multiple macros are available to easily declare, initialize and expose instance variables as well as class variables on an Object by generating simple accessor methods.

Is the same as writing:

Similarly, we can write class_getter name to define a class variable, which generates a def self.name class method returning @@name.

We can define as many variables as necessary in a single call. For example getter name, age, city will create a getter method for each of name, age and city.

Instead of plain arguments, we can specify a type as well as an initial value. If the initial value is simple enough Crystal should be able to infer the type of the instance or class variable!

Specifying a type will also declare the instance or class variable with said type and type the accessor method arguments and return type accordingly.

Is the same as writing:

The initial value of an instance variable is automatically set when the object is constructed. The initial value of a class variable will be set when the program starts up.

Instead of eagerly initializing the value, we can lazily initialize it the first time the accessor method is called.

Since the variable will be lazily initialized the type of the variable will be a nilable type. The generated method however will return the specified type only (not a nilable).

Is equivalent to writing:

Please refer to the different variants to understand how they differ from the general overview presented above:

The setter and class_setter macros are the write counterparts of the getter macros. They declare name=(value) accessor methods. The arguments behave just as for the getter macros. Each setter can have a type as well as an initial value. There is no lazy initialization however since the macro doesn't generate a getter method.

Is the same as writing:

For class variables we'd have called class_setter name that would have generated a def self.name=(@@name) class method instead.

The property macros define both getter and setter methods at once.

Is equivalent to writing:

Which is the same as writing:

Refer to Getters and Setters above for details. The macros take the exact same arguments.

Deserializes the given JSON in string_or_io into an instance of self, assuming the JSON consists of an JSON object with key root, and whose value is the value to deserialize.

Deserializes the given JSON in string_or_io into an instance of self. This simply creates a parser = JSON::PullParser and invokes new(parser): classes that want to provide JSON deserialization must provide an def initialize(parser : JSON::PullParser) method.

For example, writing:

Is equivalent to writing:

Refer to Getters for details.

Similar to class_getter but defines both raise-on-nil methods as well as query methods that return a nilable value.

Returns the boolean negation of self.

This method is a unary operator and usually written in prefix notation (!foo) but it can also be written as a regular method call (foo.!).

NOTE This is a pseudo-method provided directly by the Crystal compiler. It cannot be redefined nor overridden.

Returns true if this object is not equal to other.

By default this method is implemented as !(self == other) so there's no need to override this unless there's a more efficient way to do it.

Shortcut to !(self =~ other).

Returns true if this object is equal to other.

Subclasses override this method to provide class-specific meaning.

The #=== method is used in a case ... when ... end expression.

For example, this code:

Is equivalent to this code:

Object simply implements #=== by invoking #==, but subclasses (notably Regex) can override it to provide meaningful case-equality semantics.

Overridden by descendants (notably Regex and String) to provide meaningful pattern-match semantics.

The type of this expression is restricted to type by the compiler. type must be a constant or typeof() expression. It cannot be evaluated at runtime.

If type is not a valid restriction for the expression type, it is a compile-time error. If type is a valid restriction for the expression, but self can't be restricted to type, it raises at runtime. type may be a wider restriction than the expression type, the resulting type is narrowed to the minimal restriction.

NOTE This is a pseudo-method provided directly by the Crystal compiler. It cannot be redefined nor overridden.

Returns self or nil if can't be restricted to type.

The type of this expression is restricted to type by the compiler. If type is not a valid type restriction for the expression type, then it is restricted to Nil. type must be a constant or typeof() expression. It cannot be evaluated at runtime.

NOTE This is a pseudo-method provided directly by the Crystal compiler. It cannot be redefined nor overridden.

Returns the runtime Class of an object.

Compare it with typeof, which returns the compile-time type of an object:

Returns a shallow copy (“duplicate”) of this object.

In order to create a new object with the same value as an existing one, there are two possible routes:

A shallow copy is only one level deep whereas a deep copy copies everything below.

This distinction is only relevant for compound values. Primitive types do not have any properties that could be shared or cloned. In that case, #dup and clone are exactly the same.

The #clone method can't be defined on Object. It's not generically available for every type because cycles could be involved, and the clone logic might not need to clone everything.

Many types in the standard library, like Array, Hash, Set and Deque, and all primitive types, define #dup and clone.

Appends this object's value to hasher, and returns the modified hasher.

Usually the macro def_hash can be used to generate this method. Otherwise, invoke #hash(hasher) on each object's instance variables to accumulate the result:

Generates an UInt64 hash value for this object.

This method must have the property that a == b implies a.hash == b.hash.

The hash value is used along with #== by the Hash class to determine if two objects reference the same hash key.

Subclasses must not override this method. Instead, they must define #hash(hasher), though usually the macro def_hash can be used to generate this method.

Returns true if self is included in the collection argument.

Returns true if self is included in the collection argument.

Prints to io an unambiguous and information-rich string representation of this object, typically intended for developers.

It is similar to #to_s(IO), but often provides more information. Ideally, it should contain sufficient information to be able to recreate an object with the same value (given an identical environment).

For types that don't provide a custom implementation of this method, default implementation delegates to #to_s(IO). This said, it is advisable to have an appropriate #inspect implementation on every type. Default implementations are provided by Struct#inspect and Reference#inspect.

::p and ::p! use this method to print an object in STDOUT.

Returns an unambiguous and information-rich string representation of this object, typically intended for developers.

This method should usually not be overridden. It delegates to #inspect(IO) which can be overridden for custom implementations.

Returns true if self inherits or includes type. type must be a constant or typeof()expression. It cannot be evaluated at runtime.

NOTE This is a pseudo-method provided directly by the Crystal compiler. It cannot be redefined nor overridden.

Returns true if self is Nil.

This method is equivalent to #is_a?(Nil).

NOTE This is a pseudo-method provided directly by the Crystal compiler. It cannot be redefined nor overridden.

Nil overrides this method and raises NilAssertionError, see Nil#not_nil!.

This method can be used to remove Nil from a union type. However, it should be avoided if possible and is often considered a code smell. Usually, you can write code in a way that the compiler can safely exclude Nil types, for example using if var. #not_nil! is only meant as a last resort when there's no other way to explain this to the compiler. Either way, consider instead raising a concrete exception with a descriptive message.

message has no effect. It is only used by Nil#not_nil!(message = nil).

Returns a pretty printed version of self.

Pretty prints self into the given printer.

By default appends a text that is the result of invoking #inspect on self. Subclasses should override for custom pretty printing.

Returns true if method name can be called on self.

name must be a symbol literal, it cannot be evaluated at runtime.

NOTE This is a pseudo-method provided directly by the Crystal compiler. It cannot be redefined nor overridden.

Yields self to the block, and then returns self.

The primary purpose of this method is to "tap into" a method chain, in order to perform operations on intermediate results within the chain.

Prints a nicely readable and concise string representation of this object, typically intended for users, to io.

This method is called when an object is interpolated in a string literal:

IO#<< calls this method to append an object to itself:

Thus implementations must not interpolate self in a string literal or call io << self which both would lead to an endless loop.

Also see #inspect(IO).

Returns a nicely readable and concise string representation of this object, typically intended for users.

This method should usually not be overridden. It delegates to #to_s(IO) which can be overridden for custom implementations.

Yields self. Nil overrides this method and doesn't yield.

This method is useful for dealing with nilable types, to safely perform operations only when the value is not nil.

Unsafely reinterprets the bytes of an object as being of another type.

This method is useful to treat a type that is represented as a chunk of bytes as another type where those bytes convey useful information. As an example, you can check the individual bytes of an Int32:

Or treat the bytes of a Float64 as an Int64:

This method is unsafe because it behaves unpredictably when the given type doesn't have the same bytesize as the receiver, or when the given type representation doesn't semantically match the underlying bytes.

Also note that because #unsafe_as is a regular method, unlike the pseudo-method #as, you can't specify some types in the type grammar using a short notation, so specifying a static array must always be done as StaticArray(T, N), a tuple as Tuple(...) and so on, never as UInt8[4] or {Int32, Int32}.

**Examples:**

Example 1 (php):
```php
class Person
  getter name
end
```

Example 2 (php):
```php
class Person
  def name
    @name
  end
end
```

Example 3 (typescript):
```typescript
class Person
  getter name : String
  getter age = 0
  getter city : String = "unspecified"
end
```

Example 4 (typescript):
```typescript
class Person
  @name : String
  @age = 0
  @city : String = "unspecified"

  def name : String
    @name
  end

  def age
    @age
  end

  def city : String
    @city
  end
end

## Methods and instance variables¶

**URL:** https://crystal-lang.org/reference/1.18/syntax_and_semantics/methods_and_instance_variables.html

**Contents:**
- Methods and instance variables¶
- Getters and setters¶
- Redefining methods, and previous_def¶
- Catch-all initialization¶

We can simplify our constructor by using a shorter syntax for assigning a method parameter to an instance variable:

Right now, we can't do much with a person aside from create it with a name. Its age will always be zero. So lets add a method that makes a person become older:

Method names begin with a lowercase letter and, as a convention, only use lowercase letters, underscores and numbers.

The Crystal Standard Library provides macros which simplify the definition of getter and setter methods:

For more information on getter and setter macros, see the standard library documentation for Object#getter, Object#setter, and Object#property.

As a side note, we can define become_older inside the original Person definition, or in a separate definition: Crystal combines all definitions into a single class. The following works just fine:

If you redefine a method, the last definition will take precedence.

You can invoke the previously redefined method with previous_def:

Without arguments or parentheses, previous_def receives all of the method's parameters as arguments. Otherwise, it receives the arguments you pass to it.

Instance variables can also be initialized outside initialize methods:

This will initialize @age to zero in every constructor. This is useful to avoid duplication, but also to avoid the Nil type when reopening a class and adding instance variables to it.

**Examples:**

Example 1 (python):
```python
class Person
  def initialize(@name : String)
    @age = 0
  end

  def age
    @age
  end
end
```

Example 2 (python):
```python
class Person
  def initialize(@name : String)
    @age = 0
  end

  def age
    @age
  end

  def become_older
    @age += 1
  end
end

john = Person.new "John"
peter = Person.new "Peter"

john.age # => 0

john.become_older
john.age # => 1

peter.age # => 0
```

Example 3 (python):
```python
class Person
  property age
  getter name : String

  def initialize(@name)
    @age = 0
  end
end

john = Person.new "John"
john.age = 32
john.age # => 32
```

Example 4 (python):
```python
class Person
  def initialize(@name : String)
    @age = 0
  end
end

class Person
  def become_older
    @age += 1
  end
end
```

A pull parser allows parsing a YAML document by events.

When creating an instance, the parser is positioned in the first event. To get the event kind invoke #kind. If the event is a scalar you can invoke #value to get its string value. Other methods like #tag, #anchor and #scalar_style let you inspect other information from events.

Invoking #read_next reads the next event.

- Annotations¶

- Fields¶
  - Key/value¶
  - Positional¶
- Reading¶
  - Reading Multiple Annotations¶

Annotations can be used to add metadata to certain features in the source code. Types, methods, instance variables, and method/macro parameters may be annotated. User-defined annotations, such as the standard library's JSON::Field, are defined using the annotation keyword. A number of built-in annotations are provided by the compiler.

Users can define their own annotations using the annotation keyword, which works similarly to defining a class or struct.

The annotation can then be applied to various items, including:

Annotations are best used to store metadata about a given instance variable, type, or method so that it can be read at compile time using macros. One of the main benefits of annotations is that they are applied directly to instance variables/methods, which causes classes to look more natural since a standard macro is not needed to create these properties/methods.

A few applications for annotations:

Have an annotation that when applied to an instance variable determines if that instance variable should be serialized, or with what key. Crystal's JSON::Serializable and YAML::Serializable are examples of this.

An annotation could be used to designate a property as an ORM column. The name and type of the instance variable can be read off the TypeNode in addition to the annotation; removing the need for any ORM specific macro. The annotation itself could also be used to store metadata about the column, such as if it is nullable, the name of the column, or if it is the primary key.

Data can be stored within an annotation.

The values of annotation key/value pairs can be accessed at compile time via the [] method.

The named_args method can be used to read all key/value pairs on an annotation as a NamedTupleLiteral. This method is defined on all annotations by default, and is unique to each applied annotation.

Since this method returns a NamedTupleLiteral, all of the methods on that type are available for use. Especially #double_splat which makes it easy to pass annotation arguments to methods.

Positional values can be accessed at compile time via the [] method; however, only one index can be accessed at a time.

The args method can be used to read all positional arguments on an annotation as a TupleLiteral. This method is defined on all annotations by default, and is unique to each applied annotation.

Since the return type of TupleLiteral is iterable, we can rewrite the previous example in a better way. By extension, all of the methods on TupleLiteral are available for use as well.

Annotations can be read off of a TypeNode, Def, MetaVar, or Arg using the .annotation(type : TypeNode) method. This method return an Annotation object representing the applied annotation of the supplied type.

If multiple annotations of the same type are applied, the .annotation method will return the last one.

The @type and @def variables can be used to get a TypeNode or Def object to use the .annotation method on. However, it is also possible to get TypeNode/Def types using other methods on TypeNode. For example TypeNode.all_subclasses or TypeNode.methods, respectively.

Checkout the parse_type method for a more advanced way to obtain a TypeNode.

The TypeNode.instance_vars can be used to get an array of instance variable MetaVar objects that would allow reading annotations defined on those instance variables.

TypeNode.instance_vars currently only works in the context of an instance/class method.

Annotations can only be read off of typed block parameters. See https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/issues/5334.

The #annotations method returns an ArrayLiteral of all annotations on a type. Optionally, a TypeNode argument with the #annotations(type : TypeNode) method filters only annotations of the provided type.

**Examples:**

Example 1 (julia):
```julia
annotation MyAnnotation
end
```

Example 2 (php):
```php
annotation MyAnnotation
end

@[MyAnnotation]
def foo
  "foo"
end

@[MyAnnotation]
class Klass
end

@[MyAnnotation]
module MyModule
end

def method1(@[MyAnnotation] foo)
end

def method2(
  @[MyAnnotation]
  bar,
)
end

def method3(@[MyAnnotation] & : String ->)
end
```

Example 3 (markdown):
```markdown
annotation MyAnnotation
end

# The fields can either be a key/value pair
@[MyAnnotation(key: "value", value: 123)]

# Or positional
@[MyAnnotation("foo", 123, false)]
```

Example 4 (json):
```json
annotation MyAnnotation
end

@[MyAnnotation(value: 2)]
def annotation_value
  # The name can be a `String`, `Symbol`, or `MacroId`
  {{ @def.annotation(MyAnnotation)[:value] }}
end

annotation_value # => 2
```

    - Multiplicative¶

Crystal supports a number of operators, with one, two or three operands.

Operator expressions are actually parsed as method calls. For example a + b is semantically equivalent to a.+(b), a call to method + on a with argument b.

There are however some special rules regarding operator syntax:

Operators are implemented like any regular method, and the standard library offers many implementations, for example for math expressions.

Most operators can be implemented as regular methods.

One can assign any meaning to the operators, but it is advisable to stay within similar semantics to the generic operator meaning to avoid cryptic code that is confusing and behaves unexpectedly.

A few operators are defined directly by the compiler and cannot be redefined in user code. Examples for this are the inversion operator !, the assignment operator =, combined assignment operators such as ||= and range operators. Whether a method can be redefined is indicated by the column Overloadable in the below operator tables.

Unary operators are written in prefix notation and have only a single operand. Thus, a method implementation receives no arguments and only operates on self.

The following example demonstrates the Vector2 type as a two-dimensional vector with a unary operator method - for vector inversion.

Binary operators have two operands. Thus, a method implementation receives exactly one argument representing the second operand. The first operand is the receiver self.

The following example demonstrates the Vector2 type as a two-dimensional vector with a binary operator method + for vector addition.

Per convention, the return type of a binary operator should be the type of the first operand (the receiver), so that typeof(a <op> b) == typeof(a). Otherwise the assignment operator (a <op>= b) would unintentionally change the type of a. There can be reasonable exceptions though. For example in the standard library the float division operator / on integer types always returns Float64, because the quotient must not be limited to the value range of integers.

The conditional operator (? :) is the only ternary operator. It not parsed as a method, and its meaning cannot be changed. The compiler transforms it to an if expression.

This list is sorted by precedence, so upper entries bind stronger than lower ones.

Relational operators test a relation between two values. They include equality, inequalities, and subsumption.

The equal operator == checks whether the values of the operands are considered equal.

The not-equal operator != is a shortcut to express the inversion: a != b is supposed to be equivalent to !(a == b).

Types that implement the not-equal operator must make sure to adhere to this. Special implementations can be useful for performance reasons because inequality can often be proven faster than equality.

Both operators are expected to be commutative, i.e. a == b if and only if b == a. This is not enforced by the compiler and implementing types must take care themselves.

The standard library defines Reference#same? as another equality test that is not an operator. It checks for referential identity which determines whether two values reference the same location in memory.

Inequality operators describe the order between values.

The three-way comparison operator <=> (also known as spaceship operator) expresses the order between two elements expressed by the sign of its return value.

The standard library defines the Comparable module which derives all other inequality operators as well as the equal operator from the three-way comparison operator.

The pattern match operator =~ checks whether the value of the first operand matches the value of the second operand with pattern matching.

The no pattern match operator !~ expresses the inverse.

The case subsumption operator === (also, imprecisely called case equality operator or triple equals) checks whether the right hand operand is a member of the set described by the left hand operator. The exact interpretation varies depending on the involved data types.

The compiler inserts this operator in case ... when conditions.

There is no inverse operator.

Relational operators ==, !=, ===, <, >, <=, and >= can be chained together and are interpreted as a compound expression. For example a <= b <= c is treated as a <= b && b <= c. It is possible to mix different operators: a >= b <= c > d is equivalent to a >= b && b <= c && c > d.

It is advised to only combine operators of the same precedence class to avoid surprising bind behaviour. For instance, a == b <= c is equivalent to a == b && b <= c, while a <= b == c is equivalent to a <= (b == c).

The range operators are used in Range literals.

Splat operators can only be used for destructing tuples in method arguments. See Splats and Tuples for details.

The conditional operator (? :) is internally rewritten to an if expression by the compiler.

The assignment operator = assigns the value of the second operand to the first operand. The first operand is either a variable (in this case the operator can't be redefined) or a call (in this case the operator can be redefined). See assignment for details.

The assignment operator = is the basis for all operators that combine an operator with assignment. The general form is a <op>= b and the compiler transform that into a = a <op> b.

Exceptions to the general expansion formula are the logical operators:

There is another special case when a is an index accessor ([]), it is changed to the nilable variant ([]? on the right hand side:

All transformations assume the receiver (a) is a variable. If it is a call, the replacements are semantically equivalent but the implementation is a bit more complex (introducing an anonymous temporary variable) and expects a= to be callable.

The receiver can't be anything else than a variable or call.

Index accessors are used to query a value by index or key, for example an array item or map entry. The nilable variant []? is supposed to return nil when the index is not found, while the non-nilable variant raises in that case. Implementations in the standard-library usually raise KeyError or IndexError.

**Examples:**

Example 1 (python):
```python
struct Vector2
  getter x, y

  def initialize(@x : Int32, @y : Int32)
  end

  # Unary operator. Returns the inverted vector to `self`.
  def - : self
    Vector2.new(-x, -y)
  end
end

v1 = Vector2.new(1, 2)
-v1 # => Vector2(@x=-1, @y=-2)
```

Example 2 (python):
```python
struct Vector2
  getter x, y

  def initialize(@x : Int32, @y : Int32)
  end

  # Binary operator. Returns *other* added to `self`.
  def +(other : self) : self
    Vector2.new(x + other.x, y + other.y)
  end
end

v1 = Vector2.new(1, 2)
v2 = Vector2.new(3, 4)
v1 + v2 # => Vector2(@x=4, @y=6)
```

## struct¶

**URL:** https://crystal-lang.org/reference/1.18/syntax_and_semantics/c_bindings/struct.html

**Contents:**
- struct¶

A struct declaration inside a lib declares a C struct.

You can also specify many fields of the same type:

Recursive structs work just like you expect them to:

Structs that are defined inside a lib can be included, like modules, internally in other lib defined structs, for example:

To create an instance of a struct use new:

This allocates the struct on the stack.

A C struct starts with all its fields set to "zero": integers and floats start at zero, pointers start with an address of zero, etc.

To avoid this initialization you can use uninitialized:

You can set and get its properties:

If the assigned value is not exactly the same as the property's type, to_unsafe will be tried.

You can also initialize some fields with a syntax similar to named arguments:

A C struct is passed by value (as a copy) to functions and methods, and also passed by value when it is returned from a method:

Refer to the type grammar for the notation used in struct field types.

**Examples:**

Example 1 (julia):
```julia
lib C
  # In C:
  #
  #  struct TimeZone {
  #    int minutes_west;
  #    int dst_time;
  #  };
  struct TimeZone
    minutes_west : Int32
    dst_time : Int32
  end
end
```

Example 2 (julia):
```julia
lib C
  struct TimeZone
    minutes_west, dst_time : Int32
  end
end
```

Example 3 (julia):
```julia
lib C
  struct LinkedListNode
    prev, _next : LinkedListNode*
  end

  struct LinkedList
    head : LinkedListNode*
  end
end
```

Example 4 (julia):
```julia
lib Lib
  struct Foo
    x : Int32
    y : Int16
  end

  struct Bar
    include Foo
    z : Int8
  end
end

Lib::Bar.new # => Lib::Bar(@x=0, @y=0, @z=0)

Flushes the underlying IO.

Sets the indent string.

Sets the indent level (number of spaces).

By default the maximum nesting of arrays/objects is 99. Nesting more than this will result in a JSON::Error. Changing the value of this property allows more/less nesting.

Writes a #null value.

Writes a big decimal.

Writes the start of an object, invokes the block, and the writes the end of it.

Writes a raw value, considered a scalar, directly into the IO without processing. This is the only method that might lead to invalid JSON being generated, so you must be sure that string contains a valid JSON string.

A read-only IO object to decompress data in the gzip format.

Instances of this class wrap another IO object. When you read from this instance instance, it reads data from the underlying IO, decompresses it, and returns it to the caller.

NOTE A gzip stream can contain zero or more members. If it contains no members, #header will be nil. If it contains one or more members, only the first header will be recorded here. This is because gzipping multiple members is not common as one usually combines gzip with tar. If, however, multiple members are present then reading from this reader will return the concatenation of all the members.

## Unsafe code¶

**Contents:**
- Unsafe code¶

These parts of the language are considered unsafe:

"Unsafe" means that memory corruption, segmentation faults and crashes are possible to achieve. For example:

However, regular code usually never involves pointer manipulation or uninitialized variables. And C bindings are usually wrapped in safe wrappers that include null pointers and bounds checks.

No language is 100% safe: some parts will inevitably be low-level, interface with the operating system and involve pointer manipulation. But once you abstract that and operate on a higher level, and assume (after mathematical proof or thorough testing) that the lower grounds are safe, you can be confident that your entire codebase is safe.

**Examples:**

Example 1 (unknown):
```unknown
a = 1
ptr = pointerof(a)
ptr[100_000] = 2 # undefined behaviour, probably a segmentation fault
```

Struct is the base type of structs you create in your program. It is set as a struct's superstruct when you don't specify one:

Structs inherit from Value so they are allocated on the stack and passed by value. For this reason you should prefer using structs for immutable data types and/or stateless wrappers of other types.

Mutable structs are still allowed, but code involving them must remember that passing a struct to a method actually passes a copy to it, so the method should return the modified struct:

The standard library provides a useful record macro that allows you to create immutable structs with some fields, similar to a Tuple but using names instead of indices.

Performs basic initialization so that the given address is ready for use as an object's instance data.

EXPERIMENTAL This API is still under development. Join the discussion about custom reference allocation at #13481.

Returns true if this struct is equal to other.

See Object#hash(hasher)

Appends this struct's name and instance variables names and values to the given IO.

Same as #inspect(io).

Performs basic initialization so that the given address is ready for use as an object's instance data.

More specifically, this is the part of object initialization that occurs after memory allocation and before calling one of the #initialize overloads. It zeroes the memory, and then runs all inline instance variable initializers.

address must point to a buffer of at least sizeof(self) bytes with an alignment of alignof(self) or above. This can for example be a pointer to an uninitialized instance.

This method only works for non-virtual constructions. Neither the struct type nor address's pointee type can be an abstract struct.

See also: Reference.pre_initialize.

EXPERIMENTAL This API is still under development. Join the discussion about custom reference allocation at #13481.

Returns true if this struct is equal to other.

Both structs' instance vars are compared to each other. Thus, two structs are considered equal if each of their instance variables are equal. Subclasses should override this method to provide specific equality semantics.

## if¶

**Contents:**
- if¶

An if evaluates the given branch if its condition is truthy. Otherwise, it evaluates the else branch if present.

To write a chain of if-else-if you use elsif:

After an if, a variable’s type depends on the type of the expressions used in both branches.

Note that if a variable is declared inside one of the branches but not in the other one, at the end of the if it will also contain the Nil type.

Inside an if's branch the type of a variable is the one it got assigned in that branch, or the one that it had before the branch if it was not reassigned:

That is, a variable’s type is the type of the last expression(s) assigned to it.

If one of the branches never reaches past the end of an if, like in the case of a return, next, break or raise, that type is not considered at the end of the if:

**Examples:**

Example 1 (javascript):
```javascript
a = 1
if a > 0
  a = 10
end
a # => 10

b = 1
if b > 2
  b = 10
else
  b = 20
end
b # => 20
```

Example 2 (julia):
```julia
if some_condition
  do_something
elsif some_other_condition
  do_something_else
else
  do_that
end
```

Example 3 (markdown):
```markdown
a = 1
if some_condition
  a = "hello"
else
  a = true
end
# a : String | Bool

b = 1
if some_condition
  b = "hello"
end
# b : Int32 | String

if some_condition
  c = 1
else
  c = "hello"
end
# c : Int32 | String

if some_condition
  d = 1
end
# d : Int32 | Nil
```

Example 4 (markdown):
```markdown
a = 1
if some_condition
  a = "hello"
  # a : String
  a.size
end
# a : String | Int32

A tuple is a fixed-size, immutable, stack-allocated sequence of values of possibly different types.

You can think of a Tuple as an immutable Array whose types for each position are known at compile time.

A tuple can be created with the usual .new method or with a tuple literal:

See Tuple literals in the language reference.

The compiler knows what types are in each position, so when indexing a tuple with an integer literal the compiler will return the value in that index and with the expected type, like in the above snippet. Indexing with an integer literal outside the bounds of the tuple will give a compile-time error.

Indexing with an integer value that is only known at runtime will return a value whose type is the union of all the types in the tuple, and might raise IndexError.

Indexing with #[]? does not make the return value nilable if the index is known to be within bounds:

Indexing with a range literal known at compile-time is also allowed, and the returned value will have the correct sub-tuple type:

Tuple's own instance classes may also be indexed in a similar manner, returning their element types instead:

Tuples are the preferred way to return fixed-size multiple return values because no memory is needed to be allocated for them:

Good examples of the above are Number#divmod and Enumerable#minmax.

Tuples can be splat with the * operator and passed to methods:

Finally, when using a splat argument in a method definition its type will be a tuple of the call arguments:

Creates a tuple from the given array, with elements casted to the given types.

Creates a tuple from the given array, with elements casted to the given types.

Creates a tuple that will contain the given values.

This method is useful in macros and generic code because with it you can create empty tuples, something that you can't do with a tuple literal.

Returns the element type at the given index. Read the type docs to understand the difference between indexing with a number literal or a variable.

Returns all element types that are within the given range. range must be a range literal whose value is known at compile-time.

Negative indices count backward from the end of the tuple (-1 is the last element). Additionally, an empty tuple is returned when the starting index for an element range is at the end of the tuple.

Raises a compile-time error if range.begin is out of range.

Returns the element type at the given index or nil if out of bounds. Read the type docs to understand the difference between indexing with a number literal or a variable.

Returns the types of this tuple type.

Returns a tuple that contains self's elements followed by other's elements.

The comparison operator.

Each object in each tuple is compared using the <=> operator.

Tuples are compared in an "element-wise" manner; the first element of this tuple is compared with the first one of other using the <=> operator, then each of the second elements, etc. As soon as the result of any such comparison is non-zero (i.e. the two corresponding elements are not equal), that result is returned for the whole tuple comparison.

If all the elements are equal, then the result is based on a comparison of the tuple sizes. Thus, two tuples are "equal" according to <=> if, and only if, they have the same size and the value of each element is equal to the value of the corresponding element in the other tuple.

Returns the last element of this tuple. Doesn't compile if the tuple is empty.

Returns the last element of this tuple, or nil if this is the empty tuple.

Returns a new tuple where elements are mapped by the given block.

Like #map, but the block gets passed both the element and its index.

Accepts an optional offset parameter, which tells it to start counting from there.

Just like the other variant, but you can set the initial value of the accumulator.

Combines all elements in the collection by applying a binary operation, specified by a block, so as to reduce them to a single value.

For each element in the collection the block is passed an accumulator value (memo) and the element. The result becomes the new value for memo. At the end of the iteration, the final value of memo is the return value for the method. The initial value for the accumulator is the first element in the collection. If the collection has only one element, that element is returned.

Raises Enumerable::EmptyError if the collection is empty.

The block is not required to return a T, in which case the accumulator's type includes whatever the block returns.

Similar to #reduce, but instead of raising when the input is empty, return nil

Returns a new tuple where the elements are in reverse order.

Yields each of the elements in this tuple in reverse order.

Returns the number of elements in this tuple.

Returns an Array with all the elements in the tuple.

Appends a string representation of this tuple to the given IO.

Returns a StaticArray with the same elements.

The element type is Union(*T).

Returns the element at the given index, without doing any bounds check.

Indexable makes sure to invoke this method with index in 0...size, so converting negative indices to positive ones is not needed here.

Clients never invoke this method directly. Instead, they access elements with #[](index) and #[]?(index).

This method should only be directly invoked if you are absolutely sure the index is in bounds, to avoid a bounds check for a small boost of performance.

## Default parameter values and named arguments¶

**URL:** https://crystal-lang.org/reference/1.18/syntax_and_semantics/default_and_named_arguments.html

**Contents:**
- Default parameter values and named arguments¶
- Default parameter values¶
- Named arguments¶

A method can specify default values for the last parameters:

All arguments can also be specified, in addition to their position, by their name. For example:

When there are many arguments, the order of the names in the invocation doesn't matter, as long as all required parameters are covered:

When a method specifies a splat parameter (explained in the next section), named arguments can't be used for positional parameters. The reason is that understanding how arguments are matched becomes very difficult; positional arguments are easier to reason about in this case.

**Examples:**

Example 1 (python):
```python
class Person
  def become_older(by = 1)
    @age += by
  end
end

john = Person.new "John"
john.age # => 0

john.become_older
john.age # => 1

john.become_older 2
john.age # => 3
```

Example 2 (json):
```json
john.become_older by: 5
```

Example 3 (python):
```python
def some_method(x, y = 1, z = 2, w = 3)
  # do something...
end

some_method 10                   # x: 10, y: 1, z: 2, w: 3
some_method 10, z: 10            # x: 10, y: 1, z: 10, w: 3
some_method 10, w: 1, y: 2, z: 3 # x: 10, y: 2, z: 3, w: 1
some_method y: 10, x: 20         # x: 20, y: 10, z: 2, w: 3

some_method y: 10 # Error, missing argument: x

A String represents an immutable sequence of UTF-8 characters.

A String is typically created with a string literal, enclosing UTF-8 characters in double quotes:

See String literals in the language reference.

A backslash can be used to denote some characters inside the string:

You can use a backslash followed by an u and four hexadecimal characters to denote a unicode codepoint written:

Or you can use curly braces and specify up to six hexadecimal numbers (0 to 10FFFF):

A string can span multiple lines:

Note that in the above example trailing and leading spaces, as well as newlines, end up in the resulting string. To avoid this, you can split a string into multiple lines by joining multiple literals with a backslash:

Alternatively, a backslash followed by a newline can be inserted inside the string literal:

In this case, leading whitespace is not included in the resulting string.

If you need to write a string that has many double quotes, parentheses, or similar characters, you can use alternative literals:

To create a String with embedded expressions, you can use string interpolation:

This ends up invoking Object#to_s(IO) on each expression enclosed by #{...}.

If you need to dynamically build a string, use String#build or IO::Memory.

A string might end up being composed of bytes which form an invalid byte sequence according to UTF-8. This can happen if the string is created via one of the constructors that accept bytes, or when getting a string from String.build or IO::Memory. No exception will be raised, but every byte that doesn't start a valid UTF-8 byte sequence is interpreted as though it encodes the Unicode replacement character (U+FFFD) by itself. For example:

One can also create strings with specific byte value in them by using octal and hexadecimal escape sequences:

The reason for allowing strings that don't have a valid UTF-8 sequence is that the world is full of content that isn't properly encoded, and having a program raise an exception or stop because of this is not good. It's better if programs are more resilient, but show a replacement character when there's an error in incoming data.

Note that this interpretation only applies to methods inside Crystal; calling #to_slice or #to_unsafe, e.g. when passing a string to a C library, will expose the invalid UTF-8 byte sequences. In particular, Regex's underlying engine may reject strings that are not valid UTF-8, or it may invoke undefined behavior on invalid strings. If this is undesired, #scrub could be used to remove the offending byte sequences first.

Creates a new String from the given bytes, which are encoded in the given encoding.

The invalid argument can be:

Creates a new String from a pointer, indicating its bytesize count and, optionally, the UTF-8 codepoints count (size). Bytes will be copied from the pointer.

If the given size is zero, the amount of UTF-8 codepoints will be lazily computed when needed.

Creates a String from a pointer. Bytes will be copied from the pointer.

This method is unsafe: the pointer must point to data that eventually contains a zero byte that indicates the ends of the string. Otherwise, the result of this method is undefined and might cause a segmentation fault.

This method is typically used in C bindings, where you get a char* from a library and the library guarantees that this pointer eventually has an ending zero byte.

Creates a String from the given slice. Bytes will be copied from the slice.

This method is always safe to call, and the resulting string will have the contents and size of the slice.

If truncate_at_null is true, only the characters up to and not including the first null character are copied.

Creates a new String by allocating a buffer (Pointer(UInt8)) with the given capacity, then yielding that buffer. The block must return a tuple with the bytesize and size (UTF-8 codepoints count) of the String. If the returned size is zero, the UTF-8 codepoints count will be lazily computed.

The bytesize returned by the block must be less than or equal to the capacity given to this String, otherwise ArgumentError is raised.

If you need to build a String where the maximum capacity is unknown, use String#build.

Decodes the given slice UTF-16 sequence into a String and returns the pointer after reading. The string ends when a zero value is found.

Invalid values are encoded using the unicode replacement char with codepoint 0xfffd.

Interpolates other into the string using top-level ::sprintf.

Concatenates str and other.

Concatenates str and other.

The comparison operator.

Compares this string with other, returning -1, 0 or 1 depending on whether this string is less, equal or greater than other.

Comparison is done byte-per-byte: if a byte is less than the other corresponding byte, -1 is returned and so on. This means two strings containing invalid UTF-8 byte sequences may compare unequal, even when they both produce the Unicode replacement character at the same string indices.

If the strings are of different lengths, and the strings are equal when compared up to the shortest length, then the longer string is considered greater than the shorter one.

The comparison is case-sensitive. #compare is a case-insensitive alternative.

Returns true if this string is equal to `other.

Equality is checked byte-per-byte: if any byte is different from the corresponding byte, it returns false. This means two strings containing invalid UTF-8 byte sequences may compare unequal, even when they both produce the Unicode replacement character at the same string indices.

Thus equality is case-sensitive, as it is with the comparison operator (#<=>). #compare offers a case-insensitive alternative.

Open ended ranges are clamped at the start and end of self, respectively.

Negative range values are added to self.size, thus they are treated as character indices counting from the end, -1 designating the last character.

If backreferences is true (the default value), replacement can include backreferences:

When substitution is performed, any backreferences found in replacement will be replaced with the contents of the corresponding capture group in pattern. Backreferences to capture groups that were not present in pattern or that did not match will be skipped. See Regex for information about capture groups.

Backreferences are expressed in the form "\\d", where d is a group number, or "\\k&lt;name>" where name is the name of a named capture group. A sequence of literal characters resembling a backreference can be expressed by placing "\\" before the sequence.

Disables all session ticket generation for this context.

Configures a server from a hash-like interface.

Returns a new TLS server context with only the given method set.

For everything else this uses the defaults of your OpenSSL. Use this only if undoing the defaults that .new sets is too much hassle.

Generates a new TLS server context with sane defaults for a server connection.

Defaults to TLS_method or SSLv23_method (depending on OpenSSL version) which tells OpenSSL to negotiate the TLS or SSL protocol with the remote endpoint.

Don't change the method unless you must restrict a specific protocol to be used (eg: TLSv1.2) and nothing else. You should specify options to disable specific protocols, yet allow to negotiate from various other ones. For example the following snippet will enable the TLSv1, TLSv1.1 and TLSv1.2 protocols but disable the deprecated SSLv2 and SSLv3 protocols:

Disables all session ticket generation for this context. Tickets are used to resume earlier sessions more quickly, but in TLS 1.3 if the client connects, sends data, and closes the connection unidirectionally, the server connects, then sends a ticket after the connect handshake, the ticket send can fail with Broken Pipe. So if you have that kind of behavior (clients that never read) call this method.

**Examples:**

Example 1 (javascript):
```javascript
require "openssl"

context = OpenSSL::SSL::Context::Client.from_hash({"key" => "private.key", "cert" => "certificate.crt", "ca" => "ca.pem"})
```

Example 2 (julia):

## Virtual and abstract types¶

**URL:** https://crystal-lang.org/reference/1.18/syntax_and_semantics/virtual_and_abstract_types.html

**Contents:**
- Virtual and abstract types¶

When a variable's type combines different types under the same class hierarchy, its type becomes a virtual type. This applies to every class and struct except for Reference, Value, Int and Float. An example:

If you compile the above program with the tool hierarchy command you will see this for Person:

You can see that @pet is Animal+. The + means it's a virtual type, meaning "any class that inherits from Animal, including Animal".

The compiler will always resolve a type union to a virtual type if they are under the same hierarchy:

The compiler will always do this for classes and structs under the same hierarchy: it will find the first superclass from which all types inherit from (excluding Reference, Value, Int and Float). If it can't find one, the type union remains.

The real reason the compiler does this is to be able to compile programs faster by not creating all kinds of different similar unions, also making the generated code smaller in size. But, on the other hand, it makes sense: classes under the same hierarchy should behave in a similar way.

Lets make John's pet talk:

We get an error because the compiler now treats @pet as an Animal+, which includes Animal. And since it can't find a talk method on it, it errors.

What the compiler doesn't know is that for us, Animal will never be instantiated as it doesn't make sense to instantiate one. We have a way to tell the compiler so by marking the class as abstract:

Now the code compiles:

Marking a class as abstract will also prevent us from creating an instance of it:

To make it more explicit that an Animal must define a talk method, we can add it to Animal as an abstract method:

By marking a method as abstract the compiler will check that all subclasses implement this method (matching the parameter types and names), even if a program doesn't use them.

Abstract methods can also be defined in modules, and the compiler will check that including types implement them.

**Examples:**

Example 1 (python):
```python
class Animal
end

class Dog < Animal
  def talk
    "Woof!"
  end
end

class Cat < Animal
  def talk
    "Miau"
  end
end

class Person
  getter pet

  def initialize(@name : String, @pet : Animal)
  end
end

john = Person.new "John", Dog.new
peter = Person.new "Peter", Cat.new
```

Example 2 (php):
```php
- class Object
  |
  +- class Reference
     |
     +- class Person
            @name : String
            @pet : Animal+
```

Example 3 (markdown):
```markdown
if some_condition
  pet = Dog.new
else
  pet = Cat.new
end

# pet : Animal+
```

Example 4 (unknown):
```unknown
john.pet.talk # Error: undefined method 'talk' for Animal
```

Regex::MatchData is the type of the special variable $~, and is the type returned by Regex#match and String#match. It encapsulates all the results of a regular expression match.

Many Regex::MatchData methods deal with capture groups, and accept an integer argument to select the desired capture group. Capture groups are numbered starting from 1, so that 0 can be used to refer to the entire regular expression without needing to capture it explicitly.

Returns count or less (if there aren't enough) matches starting at the given start index.

Returns the match of the nth capture group, or raises an IndexError if there is no nth capture group.

Returns the match of the capture group named by group_name, or raises an KeyError if there is no such named capture group.

Returns all matches that are within the given range.

Like #[](Int, Int) but returns nil if the start index is out of range.

Returns the match of the nth capture group, or nil if there isn't an nth capture group.

Returns the match of the capture group named by group_name, or nil if there is no such named capture group.

Like #[](Range), but returns nil if the range's start is out of range.

Returns the position of the first character of the nth match.

Returns the position of the first byte of the nth match.

Returns the position of the next byte after the match.

Returns an array of unnamed capture groups.

Returns a shallow copy of this object.

Returns the position of the next character after the match.

Returns the number of capture groups, including named capture groups.

See Object#hash(hasher)

Appends this struct's name and instance variables names and values to the given IO.

Returns a hash of named capture groups.

Returns the part of the original string after the match.

Returns the part of the original string before the match.

Returns the original regular expression.

Returns the number of elements in this match object.

Returns the original string.

Convert this match data into an array.

Convert this match data into a hash.

Prints the matched substring to io.

Returns the matched substring.

Returns count or less (if there aren't enough) matches starting at the given start index.

Returns the match of the nth capture group, or raises an IndexError if there is no nth capture group.

Returns the match of the capture group named by group_name, or raises an KeyError if there is no such named capture group.

When there are capture groups having same name, it returns the last matched capture group.

Returns all matches that are within the given range.

Like #[](Int, Int) but returns nil if the start index is out of range.

Returns the match of the nth capture group, or nil if there isn't an nth capture group.

When n is 0, returns the match for the entire Regex.

Returns the match of the capture group named by group_name, or nil if there is no such named capture group.

When there are capture groups having same name, it returns the last matched capture group.

Like #[](Range), but returns nil if the range's start is out of range.

Returns the position of the first character of the nth match.

When n is 0 or not given, uses the match of the entire Regex. Otherwise, uses the match of the nth capture group.

Raises IndexError if the index is out of range or the respective subpattern is unused.

Returns the position of the first byte of the nth match.

When n is 0 or not given, uses the match of the entire Regex. Otherwise, uses the match of the nth capture group.

Raises IndexError if the index is out of range or the respective subpattern is unused.

Returns the position of the next byte after the match.

When n is 0 or not given, uses the match of the entire Regex. Otherwise, uses the match of the nth capture group.

Raises IndexError if the index is out of range or the respective subpattern is unused.

Returns an array of unnamed capture groups.

It is a difference from #to_a that the result array does not contain the match for the entire Regex (self[0]).

Returns a shallow copy of this object.

Because Value is a value type, this method returns self, which already involves a shallow copy of this object because value types are passed by value.

Returns the position of the next character after the match.

When n is 0 or not given, uses the match of the entire Regex. Otherwise, uses the match of the nth capture group.

Raises IndexError if the index is out of range or the respective subpattern is unused.

Returns the number of capture groups, including named capture groups.

See Object#hash(hasher)

Appends this struct's name and instance variables names and values to the given IO.

Returns a hash of named capture groups.

Returns the part of the original string after the match. If the match ends at the end of the string, returns the empty string.

Returns the part of the original string before the match. If the match starts at the start of the string, returns the empty string.

Returns the original regular expression.

Returns the number of elements in this match object.

Returns the original string.

Convert this match data into an array.

Convert this match data into a hash.

Prints the matched substring to io.

Returns the matched substring.

**Examples:**

Example 1 (javascript):
```javascript
if md = "Crystal".match(/[p-s]/)
  md.string # => "Crystal"
  md[0]     # => "r"
  md[1]?    # => nil
end
```

Example 2 (javascript):
```javascript
"Crystal".match!(/r(ys)/)[1] # => "ys"
"Crystal".match!(/r(ys)/)[2] # raises IndexError
```

Example 3 (typescript):
```typescript
"Crystal".match!(/r(?<ok>ys)/)["ok"] # => "ys"
"Crystal".match!(/r(?<ok>ys)/)["ng"] # raises KeyError
```

Example 4 (typescript):

A fictitious node representing an identifier like, foo, Bar or something_else.

The parser doesn't create these nodes. Instead, you create them by invoking #id on some nodes. For example, invoking #id on a StringLiteral returns a MacroId for the string's content. Similarly, invoking ID on a SymbolLiteral, Call, Var and Path returns a MacroId for the node's content.

This allows you to treat strings, symbols, variables and calls uniformly. For example:

All of the above macro calls work because we invoked #id, and the generated code looks like this:

If we hadn't used #id, the generated code would have been this:

The last two definitions are invalid and so will give a compile-time error.

- Double splatting a named tuple¶

A method can receive a variable number of arguments by using a splat parameter (*), which can appear only once and in any position:

The passed arguments become a Tuple in the method's body:

Arguments past the splat parameter can only be passed as named arguments:

Parameters past the splat parameter without a default value are required named parameters:

Two methods with different required named parameters overload between each other:

The splat parameter can also be left unnamed, with the meaning "after this, named parameters follow":

A Tuple can be splat into a method call by using *:

A double splat (**) captures named arguments that were not matched by other parameters. The type of the parameter is a NamedTuple:

A NamedTuple can be splat into a method call by using **:

**Examples:**

Example 1 (python):
```python
def sum(*elements)
  total = 0
  elements.each do |value|
    total += value
  end
  total
end

sum 1, 2, 3      # => 6
sum 1, 2, 3, 4.5 # => 10.5
```

Example 2 (markdown):
```markdown
# elements is Tuple(Int32, Int32, Int32)
sum 1, 2, 3

# elements is Tuple(Int32, Int32, Int32, Float64)
sum 1, 2, 3, 4.5
```

Example 3 (python):
```python
def sum(*elements, initial = 0)
  total = initial
  elements.each do |value|
    total += value
  end
  total
end

sum 1, 2, 3              # => 6
sum 1, 2, 3, initial: 10 # => 16
```

Example 4 (python):
```python
def sum(*elements, initial)
  total = initial

Parses multipart MIME messages.

Please note that the IO object yielded by #next is only valid until the block returns.

Creates a new Multipart::Parser which parses io with multipart boundary boundary.

True if #next can be called legally.

Parses the next body part and yields headers as HTTP::Headers and the body text as an IO.

Creates a new Multipart::Parser which parses io with multipart boundary boundary.

True if #next can be called legally.

Parses the next body part and yields headers as HTTP::Headers and the body text as an IO.

This method yields once instead of returning the values, because the IO object yielded to the block is only valid while the block is executing. The IO object will be closed as soon as the block returns. To store the content of the body part for longer than the block, the IO must be read into memory.

**Examples:**

Example 1 (julia):
```julia
require "mime/multipart"

multipart = "--aA40\r\nContent-Type: text/plain\r\n\r\nbody\r\n--aA40--"
parser = MIME::Multipart::Parser.new(IO::Memory.new(multipart), "aA40")

- Conditionals¶

- Variadic arguments and splatting¶
- Type information¶

Macros are methods that receive AST nodes at compile-time and produce code that is pasted into a program. For example:

A macro's definition body looks like regular Crystal code with extra syntax to manipulate the AST nodes. The generated code must be valid Crystal code, meaning that you can't for example generate a def without a matching end, or a single when expression of a case, since both of them are not complete valid expressions. Refer to Pitfalls for more information.

Macros declared at the top-level are visible anywhere. If a top-level macro is marked as private it is only accessible in that file.

They can also be defined in classes and modules, and are visible in those scopes. Macros are also looked-up in the ancestors chain (superclasses and included modules).

For example, a block which is given an object to use as the default receiver by being invoked with with ... yield can access macros defined within that object's ancestors chain:

Macros defined in classes and modules can be invoked from outside of them too:

You use {{...}} to paste, or interpolate, an AST node, as in the above example.

Note that the node is pasted as-is. If in the previous example we pass a symbol, the generated code becomes invalid:

Note that :foo was the result of the interpolation, because that's what was passed to the macro. You can use the method ASTNode#id in these cases, where you just need an identifier.

You can invoke a fixed subset of methods on AST nodes at compile-time. These methods are documented in a fictitious Crystal::Macros module.

For example, invoking ASTNode#id in the above example solves the problem:

Most AST nodes are obtained via either manually passed arguments, hard coded values, or retrieved from either the type or method information helper variables. Yet there might be cases in which a node is not directly accessible, such as if you use information from different contexts to construct the path to the desired type/constant.

In such cases the parse_type macro method can help by parsing the provided StringLiteral into something that can be resolved into the desired AST node.

See the API docs for more examples.

Modules, classes and structs can also be generated:

You use {% if condition %} ... {% end %} to conditionally generate code:

Similar to regular code, Nop, NilLiteral and a false BoolLiteral are considered falsey, while everything else is considered truthy.

Macro conditionals can be used outside a macro definition:

You can iterate a finite amount of times:

To iterate an ArrayLiteral:

The index variable in the above example is optional.

To iterate a HashLiteral:

Macro iterations can be used outside a macro definition:

A macro can accept variadic arguments:

The arguments are packed into a TupleLiteral and passed to the macro.

Additionally, using * when interpolating a TupleLiteral interpolates the elements separated by commas:

When a macro is invoked you can access the current scope, or type, with a special instance variable: @type. The type of this variable is TypeNode, which gives you access to type information at compile time.

Note that @type is always the instance type, even when the macro is invoked in a class method.

It is possible to access the top-level namespace, as a TypeNode, with a special variable: @top_level. The following example shows its utility:

When a macro is invoked you can access the method, the macro is in with a special instance variable: @def. The type of this variable is Def unless the macro is outside of a method, in this case it's NilLiteral.

When a macro is called, you can access the macro call stack with a special instance variable: @caller. This variable returns an ArrayLiteral of Call nodes with the first element in the array being the most recent. Outside of a macro or if the macro has no caller (e.g. a hook) the value is a NilLiteral.

As of now, the returned array will always only have a single element.

Macros can access constants. For example:

If the constant denotes a type, you get back a TypeNode.

It is possible to define a macro which generates one or more macro definitions. You must escape macro expressions of the inner macro by preceding them with a backslash character "\" to prevent them from being evaluated by the outer macro.

Another way to define a nested macro is by using the special verbatim call. Using this you will not be able to use any variable interpolation but will not need to escape the inner macro characters.

Notice the variables in the inner macro are not available within the verbatim block. The contents of the block are transferred "as is", essentially as a string, until re-examined by the compiler.

Macro expressions are evaluated both within comments as well as compilable sections of code. This may be used to provide relevant documentation for expansions:

This evaluation applies to both interpolation and directives. As a result of this, macros cannot be commented out.

The expression above will result in no output.

The @caller can be combined with the #doc_comment method in order to allow merging documentation comments on a node generated by a macro, and the comments on the macro call itself. For example:

When generated, the docs for the #foo method would be like:

When writing macros (especially outside of a macro definition) it is important to remember that the generated code from the macro must be valid Crystal code by itself even before it is merged into the main program's code. This means, for example, a macro cannot generate a one or more when expressions of a case statement unless case was a part of the generated code.

Here is an example of such an invalid macro:

Notice that case is not within the macro. The code generated by the macro consists solely of two when expressions which, by themselves, is not valid Crystal code. We must include case within the macro in order to make it valid by using begin and end:

**Examples:**

Example 1 (json):
```json
macro define_method(name, content)
  def {{name}}
    {{content}}
  end
end

# This generates:
#
#     def foo
#       1
#     end
define_method foo, 1

foo # => 1
```

Example 2 (swift):
```swift
class Foo
  macro emphasize(value)
    "***#{ {{value}} }***"
  end

  def yield_with_self(&)
    with self yield
  end
end

Foo.new.yield_with_self { emphasize(10) } # => "***10***"
```

Example 3 (php):
```php
class Foo
  macro emphasize(value)
    "***#{ {{value}} }***"
  end
end

Foo.emphasize(10) # => "***10***"
```

Example 4 (markdown):
```markdown
# This generates:
#
#     def :foo
#       1
#     end
define_method :foo, 1
```

Some expressions won't return to the current scope and therefore have no return type. This is expressed as the special return type NoReturn.

Typical examples for non-returning methods and keywords are return, exit, raise, next, and break.

This is for example useful for deconstructing union types:

The compiler recognizes that in case string is Nil, the right hand side of the expression string || raise will be evaluated. Since typeof(raise "Empty input") is NoReturn the execution would not return to the current scope in that case. That leaves only String as resulting type of the expression.

Every expression whose code paths all result in NoReturn will be NoReturn as well. NoReturn does not show up in a union type because it would essentially be included in every expression's type. It is only used when an expression will never return to the current scope.

NoReturn can be explicitly set as return type of a method or function definition but will usually be inferred by the compiler.

NOTE This is a pseudo-class provided directly by the Crystal compiler. It cannot be reopened nor overridden.

**Examples:**

Example 1 (javascript):
```javascript
string = STDIN.gets
typeof(string)                        # => String?
typeof(raise "Empty input")           # => NoReturn
typeof(string || raise "Empty input") # => String

Creates a process, executes it, but doesn't wait for it to complete.

Changes the root directory and the current working directory for the current process.

Replaces the current process with a new one.

Returns an absolute path to the executable file of the currently running program.

Returns true if the process identified by pid is valid for a currently registered process, false otherwise.

Terminate the current process immediately.

Searches an executable, checking for an absolute path, a path relative to pwd or absolute path, then eventually searching in directories declared in path.

Ignores all interrupt requests.

Installs handler as the new handler for interrupt requests.

DEPRECATED Use #on_terminate instead

Installs handler as the new handler for termination requests.

Splits the given line into individual command-line arguments in a platform-specific manner, unquoting tokens if necessary.

Splits the given line into individual command-line arguments according to POSIX shell rules, unquoting tokens if necessary.

Splits the given line into individual command-line arguments according to Microsoft's standard C runtime, unquoting tokens if necessary.

Returns the process group identifier of the process identified by pid.

Returns the process group identifier of the current process.

Returns the process identifier of the current process.

Returns the process identifier of the parent process of the current process.

Converts a sequence of strings to one joined string with each argument shell-quoted.

Shell-quotes one item, same as .quote({arg}).

Converts a sequence of strings to one joined string with each argument shell-quoted.

Shell-quotes one item, same as .quote_posix({arg}).

Restores default handling of interrupt requests.

Executes a process and waits for it to complete.

Executes a process, yields the block, and then waits for it to finish.

Sends signal to the process identified by pid.

Returns a Tms for the current process.

Closes any system resources (e.g.

A pipe to this process' error.

A pipe to this process' error.

Whether the process is still registered in the system.

A pipe to this process' input.

A pipe to this process' input.

A pipe to this process' output.

A pipe to this process' output.

Returns the process identifier of this process.

Sends signal to this process.

Asks this process to terminate.

Whether this process is already terminated.

Waits for this process to complete and closes any pipes.

Creates a process, executes it, but doesn't wait for it to complete.

To wait for it to finish, invoke #wait.

By default the process is configured without input, output or error.

If shell is false, the command is the path to the executable to run, along with a list of args.

If shell is true, the command should be the full command line including space-separated args.

Raises IO::Error if executing the command fails (for example if the executable doesn't exist).

Changes the root directory and the current working directory for the current process.

Available only on Unix-like operating systems.

Security: .chroot on its own is not an effective means of mitigation. At minimum the process needs to also drop privileges as soon as feasible after the .chroot. Changes to the directory hierarchy or file descriptors passed via recvmsg(2) from outside the .chroot jail may allow a restricted process to escape, even if it is unprivileged.

Replaces the current process with a new one. This function never returns.

Raises IO::Error if executing the command fails (for example if the executable doesn't exist).

Returns an absolute path to the executable file of the currently running program. This is in opposition to PROGRAM_NAME which may be a relative or absolute path, just the executable file name or a symlink.

The executable path will be canonicalized (all symlinks and relative paths will be expanded).

Returns nil if the file can't be found.

Returns true if the process identified by pid is valid for a currently registered process, false otherwise. Note that this returns true for a process in the zombie or similar state.

Terminate the current process immediately. All open files, pipes and sockets are flushed and closed, all child processes are inherited by PID 1. This does not run any handlers registered with at_exit, use ::exit for that.

status is the exit status of the current process.

Searches an executable, checking for an absolute path, a path relative to pwd or absolute path, then eventually searching in directories declared in path.

Ignores all interrupt requests. Removes any custom interrupt handler set with #on_terminate.

Installs handler as the new handler for interrupt requests. Removes any previously set interrupt handler.

The handler is executed on a fresh fiber every time an interrupt occurs.

DEPRECATED Use #on_terminate instead

Installs handler as the new handler for termination requests. Removes any previously set termination handler.

The handler is executed on a fresh fiber every time an interrupt occurs.

Splits the given line into individual command-line arguments in a platform-specific manner, unquoting tokens if necessary.

Equivalent to .parse_arguments_posix on Unix-like systems. Equivalent to .parse_arguments_windows on Windows.

Splits the given line into individual command-line arguments according to POSIX shell rules, unquoting tokens if necessary.

Raises ArgumentError if a quotation mark is unclosed.

See https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/utilities/xcu_chap02.html#tag_02_03

Splits the given line into individual command-line arguments according to Microsoft's standard C runtime, unquoting tokens if necessary.

Raises ArgumentError if a quotation mark is unclosed. Leading spaces in line are ignored. Otherwise, this method is equivalent to CommandLineToArgvW for some unspecified program name.

NOTE This does not take strings that are passed to the CMD shell or used in a batch script.

Returns the process group identifier of the process identified by pid.

Returns the process group identifier of the current process.

Returns the process identifier of the current process.

Returns the process identifier of the parent process of the current process.

On Windows, the parent is associated only at process creation time, and the system does not re-parent the current process if the parent terminates; thus Process.exists?(Process.ppid) is not guaranteed to be true.

  - Class methods inherited from struct Struct

A Char::Reader allows iterating a String by Chars.

As soon as you instantiate a Char::Reader it will decode the first char in the String, which can be accessed by invoking #current_char. At this point #pos, the current position in the string, will equal zero. Successive calls to #next_char return the next chars in the string, advancing #pos.

NOTE The null character '\0' will be returned in #current_char when the end is reached (as well as when the string is empty). Thus, #has_next? will return false only when #pos is equal to the string's bytesize, in which case #current_char will always be '\0'.

NOTE For performance reasons, Char::Reader has value semantics, so care must be taken when a reader is declared as a local variable and passed to another method:

Creates a reader with the specified string positioned at byte index pos.

Creates a reader that will be positioned at the last char of the given string.

Returns the current character, or '\0' if the reader is at the end of the string.

Returns the current character.

Returns the size of the #current_char (in bytes) as if it were encoded in UTF-8.

Yields successive characters from #string starting from #pos.

If there was an error decoding the current char because of an invalid UTF-8 byte sequence, returns the byte that produced the invalid encoding.

Returns true if the reader is not at the end of the string.

Returns true if the reader is not at the beginning of the string.

Reads the next character in the string.

Tries to read the next character in the string.

Returns the next character in the #string without incrementing #pos.

Returns the byte position of the current character.

Reads the previous character in the string.

Tries to read the previous character in the string.

Returns the reader's String.

Creates a reader with the specified string positioned at byte index pos.

Creates a reader that will be positioned at the last char of the given string.

Returns the current character, or '\0' if the reader is at the end of the string.

Returns the current character.

Returns nil if the reader is at the end of the string.

Returns the size of the #current_char (in bytes) as if it were encoded in UTF-8.

Yields successive characters from #string starting from #pos.

If there was an error decoding the current char because of an invalid UTF-8 byte sequence, returns the byte that produced the invalid encoding. Returns 0 if the char would've been out of bounds. Otherwise returns nil.

Returns true if the reader is not at the end of the string.

NOTE This only means #next_char will successfully increment #pos; if the reader is already at the last character, #next_char will return the terminating null byte because there isn't really a next character.

Returns true if the reader is not at the beginning of the string.

Reads the next character in the string.

If the reader is at the end of the string after incrementing #pos, returns '\0'. If the reader is already at the end beforehand, raises IndexError.

Tries to read the next character in the string.

If the reader is at the end of the string before or after incrementing #pos, returns nil.

Returns the next character in the #string without incrementing #pos.

Returns '\0' if the reader is at the last character of the string. Raises IndexError if the reader is at the end.

Returns the byte position of the current character.

Reads the previous character in the string.

Raises IndexError if the reader is already at the beginning of the string. Otherwise decrements #pos.

Tries to read the previous character in the string.

Returns nil if the reader is already at the beginning of the string. Otherwise decrements #pos.

Returns the reader's String.

**Examples:**

Example 1 (julia):
```julia
def lstrip(reader)
  until reader.current_char.whitespace?
    reader.next_char
  end
  reader
end

# caller's internal state is untouched
reader = Char::Reader.new("   abc")
lstrip(reader)
reader.current_char # => ' '

# to modify caller's internal state, the method must return a new reader
reader = lstrip(reader)
reader.current_char # => 'a'
```

Example 2 (javascript):
```javascript
reader = Char::Reader.new("ab")
reader.current_char # => 'a'
reader.next_char
reader.current_char # => 'b'
reader.next_char
reader.current_char # => '\0'
```

Example 3 (javascript):
```javascript
reader = Char::Reader.new("aé")
reader.current_char_width # => 1
reader.next_char
reader.current_char_width # => 2
```

Example 4 (julia):
```julia
reader = Char::Reader.new("abc")
reader.next_char
reader.each do |c|
  puts c.upcase

## fun¶

**Contents:**
- fun¶
- Function names¶
- Types in C Bindings¶

A fun declaration inside a lib binds to a C function.

Once you bind it, the function is available inside the C type as if it was a class method:

You can omit the parentheses if the function doesn't have parameters (and omit them in the call as well):

If the return type is void you can omit it:

You can bind to variadic functions:

Note that there are no implicit conversions (except to_unsafe, which is explained later) when invoking a C function: you must pass the exact type that is expected. For integers and floats you can use the various to_... methods.

Function names in a lib definition can start with an upper case letter. That's different from methods and function definitions outside a lib, which must start with a lower case letter.

Function names in Crystal can be different from the C name. The following example shows how to bind the C function name SDL_Init as LibSDL.init in Crystal.

The C name can be put in quotes to be able to write a name that is not a valid identifier:

This can also be used to give shorter, nicer names to C functions, as these tend to be long and are usually prefixed with the library name.

The valid types to use in C bindings are:

Refer to the type grammar for the notation used in fun types.

The standard library defines the LibC lib with aliases for common C types, like int, short, size_t. Use them in bindings like this:

The C char type is UInt8 in Crystal, so a char* or a const char* is UInt8*. The Char type in Crystal is a unicode codepoint so it is represented by four bytes, making it similar to an Int32, not to an UInt8. There's also the alias LibC::Char if in doubt.

**Examples:**

Example 1 (julia):
```julia
lib C
  # In C: double cos(double x)
  fun cos(value : Float64) : Float64
end
```

Example 2 (javascript):
```javascript
C.cos(1.5) # => 0.0707372
```

Example 3 (julia):
```julia
lib C
  fun getch : Int32
end

C.getch
```

Example 4 (julia):
```julia
lib C
  fun srand(seed : UInt32)
end

C.srand(1_u32)

The arena allocates objects T at a predefined index. The object itself is uninitialized (outside of having its memory initialized to zero). The object can be allocated and later retrieved using the generation index (Arena::Index) that contains both the actual index (Int32) and the generation number (UInt32). Deallocating the object increases the generation number, which allows the object to be reallocated later on. Trying to retrieve the allocation using the generation index will fail if the generation number changed (it's a new allocation).

This arena isn't generic as it won't keep a list of free indexes. It assumes that something else will maintain the uniqueness of indexes and reuse indexes as much as possible instead of growing.

For example this arena is used to hold Crystal::EventLoop::Polling::PollDescriptor allocations for all the fd in a program, where the fd is used as the index. They're unique to the process and the OS always reuses the lowest fd numbers before growing.

Thread safety: the memory region is divided in blocks of size BLOCK_BYTESIZE allocated in the GC. Pointers are thus never invalidated. Mutating the blocks is protected by a mutual exclusion lock. Individual (de)allocations of objects are protected with a fine grained lock.

Guarantees: blocks' memory is initialized to zero, which means T objects are initialized to zero by default, then #free will also clear the memory, so the next allocation shall be initialized to zero, too.

Same as #allocate_at? but raises when already allocated.

Allocates the object at index unless already allocated, then yields a pointer to the object at index and the current generation index to later retrieve and free the allocated object.

Iterates all allocated objects, yields the actual index as well as the generation index.

Yields the object previously allocated at index then releases it.

Yields a pointer to the object previously allocated at index.

Yields a pointer to the object previously allocated at index and returns true.

Same as #allocate_at? but raises when already allocated.

Allocates the object at index unless already allocated, then yields a pointer to the object at index and the current generation index to later retrieve and free the allocated object. Eventually returns the generation index.

Does nothing if the object has already been allocated and returns nil.

There are no generational checks. Raises if index is out of bounds.

Iterates all allocated objects, yields the actual index as well as the generation index.

Yields the object previously allocated at index then releases it.

Does nothing if the object isn't allocated, the generation has changed or index is out of bounds.

Yields a pointer to the object previously allocated at index.

Raises if the object isn't allocated, the generation has changed (i.e. the object has been freed then reallocated) or index is out of bounds.

Yields a pointer to the object previously allocated at index and returns true.

Does nothing if the object isn't allocated, the generation has changed or index is out of bounds.

The Enumerable mixin provides collection classes with several traversal, searching, filtering and querying methods.

## Modules¶

**URL:** https://crystal-lang.org/reference/1.18/syntax_and_semantics/modules.html

**Contents:**
- Modules¶
- extend self¶
- Module Type Checking¶

Modules serve two purposes:

An example of a module as a namespace:

Library authors are advised to put their definitions inside a module to avoid name clashes. The standard library usually doesn't have a namespace as its types and methods are very common, to avoid writing long names.

To use a module as a partial type you use include or extend.

An include makes a type include methods defined in that module as instance methods:

In the above example, it is as if we pasted the size method from the module into the Items class. The way this really works is by making each type have a list of ancestors, or parents. By default this list starts with the superclass. As modules are included they are prepended to this list. When a method is not found in a type it is looked up in this list. When you invoke super, the first type in this ancestors list is used.

A module can include other modules, so when a method is not found in it it will be looked up in the included modules.

An extend makes a type include methods defined in that module as class methods:

Both include and extend make constants defined in the module available to the including/extending type.

Both of them can be used at the top level to avoid writing a namespace over and over (although the chances of name clashes increase):

A common pattern for modules is extend self:

In this way a module can be used as a namespace:

But also it can be included in the program and its methods can be invoked without a namespace:

For this to be useful the method name should have some reference to the module, otherwise chances of name clashes are high.

A module cannot be instantiated:

Modules can also be used for type checking.

If we define two modules with names A and B:

These can be included into classes:

We can then type check against instances of these classes with not only their class, but the included modules as well:

This allows you to define arrays and methods based on module type instead of class:

**Examples:**

Example 1 (julia):
```julia
module Curses

An Array is an ordered, integer-indexed collection of objects of type T.

Array indexing starts at 0. A negative index is assumed to be relative to the end of the array: -1 indicates the last element, -2 is the next to last element, and so on.

An Array can be created using the usual .new method (several are provided), or with an array literal:

See Array literals in the language reference.

An Array can have mixed types, meaning T will be a union of types, but these are determined when the array is created, either by specifying T or by using an array literal. In the latter case, T will be set to the union of the array literal elements' types.

When creating an empty array you must always specify T:

An Array is implemented using an internal buffer of some capacity and is reallocated when elements are pushed to it when more capacity is needed. This is normally known as a dynamic array.

You can use a special array literal syntax with other types too, as long as they define an argless .new method and a << method. Set is one such type:

The above is the same as this:

Sorts all elements in self by the output value of the block. The output values are compared via the comparison method #<=> (see Comparable#<=>), using an unstable sort algorithm.

This sort operation modifies self. See #unstable_sort_by(&block : T -> _) for a non-modifying option that allocates a new instance.

If stability is necessary, use #sort_by!(&block : T -> _) instead.

See #unstable_sort!(&block : T -> _) for details on the sorting mechanism.

Raises ArgumentError if the comparison between any two comparison values returns nil.

**Examples:**

Example 1 (json):
```json
Array(Int32).new  # => []
[1, 2, 3]         # Array(Int32)
[1, "hello", 'x'] # Array(Int32 | String | Char)
```

Example 2 (json):
```json
[] of Int32 # same as Array(Int32)
[]          # syntax error
```

Example 3 (javascript):
```javascript
set = Set{1, 2, 3} # => Set{1, 2, 3}
set.class          # => Set(Int32)
```

Example 4 (unknown):
```unknown
set = Set(typeof(1, 2, 3)).new
set << 1
set << 2
set << 3
```

A Range represents an interval: a set of values with a beginning and an end.

Ranges may be constructed using the usual .new method or with literals:

See Range literals in the language reference.

An easy way to remember which one is inclusive and which one is exclusive it to think of the extra dot as if it pushes y further away, thus leaving it outside of the range.

Ranges typically involve integers, but can be created using arbitrary objects as long as they define succ (or pred for #reverse_each), to get the next element in the range, and < and #==, to know when the range reached the end:

An example of using Xs to construct a range:

Constructs a Range using the given beginning and end.

Same as #includes?, useful for the case expression.

Returns the object that defines the beginning of this range.

By using binary search, returns the first element for which the passed block returns a truthy value.

Returns a new Range with #begin and #end cloned.

Returns an Iterator that cycles over the values of this range.

Iterates over the elements of this range, passing each in turn to the block.

Returns an Iterator over the elements of this range.

Returns the object that defines the end of the range.

Returns true if this range excludes the end element.

Returns true if the range is exclusive.

Returns true if this range includes the given value.

Appends this struct's name and instance variables names and values to the given IO.

Returns an Array with the results of running the block against each element of the collection.

Iterates over the elements of this range in reverse order, passing each in turn to the block.

Returns a reverse Iterator over the elements of this range.

Optimized version of Enumerable#sample that runs in O(1) time when self is an Int or Float range.

Returns the number of values in this range.

Iterates from #begin to #end incrementing by the amount of step on each iteration.

Iterates from #begin to #end incrementing by the amount of step on each iteration.

Optimized version of Enumerable#sum that runs in O(1) time when self is an Int range.

Same as #inspect(io).

Constructs a Range using the given beginning and end.

Same as #includes?, useful for the case expression.

See also: Object#===.

Returns the object that defines the beginning of this range.

By using binary search, returns the first element for which the passed block returns a truthy value.

If the block returns a falsey value, the element to be found lies behind. If the block returns a truthy value, the element to be found is itself or lies in front.

Returns nil if the block didn't return a truthy value for any element.

Returns a new Range with #begin and #end cloned.

Returns an Iterator that cycles over the values of this range.

Iterates over the elements of this range, passing each in turn to the block.

Returns an Iterator over the elements of this range.

Returns the object that defines the end of the range.

Returns true if this range excludes the end element.

Returns true if the range is exclusive. Returns false otherwise (default).

Returns true if this range includes the given value.

Appends this struct's name and instance variables names and values to the given IO.

Returns an Array with the results of running the block against each element of the collection.

Iterates over the elements of this range in reverse order, passing each in turn to the block.

Returns a reverse Iterator over the elements of this range.

Optimized version of Enumerable#sample that runs in O(1) time when self is an Int or Float range. In these cases, this range is considered to be a distribution of numeric values rather than a collection of elements, and the method simply calls random.rand(self).

Raises ArgumentError if self is an open range.

If self is not empty and n is equal to 1, calls #sample(random) exactly once. Thus, random will be left in a different state compared to the implementation in Enumerable.

Returns the number of values in this range.

If both the beginning and the end of this range are Ints, runs in constant time instead of linear.

Raises OverflowError if the difference is bigger than Int32. Raises ArgumentError if either #begin or #end are nil.

Iterates from #begin to #end incrementing by the amount of step on each iteration.

If B is a Steppable, implementation is delegated to Steppable#step. Otherwise #succ method is expected to be defined on #begin and its successors and iteration is based on calling #succ sequentially (step times per iteration).

Raises ArgumentError if #begin is nil.

Iterates from #begin to #end incrementing by the amount of step on each iteration.

If B is a Steppable, implementation is delegated to Steppable#step. Otherwise #succ method is expected to be defined on #begin and its successors and iteration is based on calling #succ sequentially (step times per iteration).

Raises ArgumentError if #begin is nil.

Optimized version of Enumerable#sum that runs in O(1) time when self is an Int range.

Same as #inspect(io).

**Examples:**

Example 1 (json):
```json
x..y  # an inclusive range, in mathematics: [x, y]
x...y # an exclusive range, in mathematics: [x, y)
(x..) # an endless range, in mathematics: >= x
..y   # a beginless inclusive range, in mathematics: <= y
...y  # a beginless exclusive range, in mathematics: < y
```

Example 2 (python):
```python
# Represents a string of 'x's.
struct Xs
  include Comparable(Xs)

  getter size

  def initialize(@size : Int32)
  end

  def succ
    Xs.new(@size + 1)

    @size.times { io << 'x' }
  end

  def to_s(io)
    io << @size << ' '
    inspect(io)
  end
end

r = Xs.new(3)..Xs.new(6)
r.to_s                 # => "xxx..xxxxxx"

## Generics¶

**URL:** https://crystal-lang.org/reference/1.18/syntax_and_semantics/generics.html

**Contents:**
- Generics¶
- Generic class methods¶
- Generic structs and modules¶
- Generic types inheritance¶
- Generics with variable number of arguments¶

Generics allow you to parameterize a type based on another type. Generics provide type-polymorphism. Consider a Box type:

Generics are especially useful for implementing collection types. Array, Hash, Set are generic types, as is Pointer.

More than one type parameter is allowed:

Any name can be used for type parameters:

Type restrictions in a generic type's class method become free variables when the receiver's type arguments were not specified. Those free variables are then inferred from a call's arguments. For example, one can also write:

In the above code we didn't have to specify the type arguments of MyBox, the compiler inferred them following this process:

In this way generic types are less tedious to work with. Note that the #initialize method itself does not need to specify any free variables for this to work.

The same type inference also works for class methods other than .new:

In these examples, T is only inferred as a free variable, so the T of the receiver itself remains unbound. Thus it is an error to call other class methods where T cannot be inferred:

Structs and modules can be generic too. When a module is generic you include it like this:

Note that in the above example T becomes Int32 because Foo.new(1) makes U become Int32, which in turn makes T become Int32 via the inclusion of the generic module.

Generic classes and structs can be inherited. When inheriting you can specify an instance of the generic type, or delegate type variables:

We may define a Generic class with a variable number of arguments using the splat operator.

Let's see an example where we define a Generic class called Foo and then we will use it with different number of type variables:

In the following example we define classes by inheritance, specifying instances for the generic types:

And if we need to instantiate a class with 0 arguments? In that case we may do:

But we should not mistake 0 arguments with not specifying the generic type variables. The following examples will raise an error:

**Examples:**

Example 1 (python):
```python
class MyBox(T)
  def initialize(@value : T)
  end

  def value
    @value
  end
end

int_box = MyBox(Int32).new(1)
int_box.value # => 1 (Int32)

string_box = MyBox(String).new("hello")
string_box.value # => "hello" (String)

another_box = MyBox(String).new(1) # Error, Int32 doesn't match String
```

Example 2 (php):
```php
class MyDictionary(K, V)
end
```

Example 3 (php):
```php
class MyDictionary(KeyType, ValueType)
end
```

Example 4 (unknown):
```unknown
int_box = MyBox.new(1)          # : MyBox(Int32)
string_box = MyBox.new("hello") # : MyBox(String)
```

Domain name resolver.

On most platforms, DNS queries are currently resolved synchronously. Calling a resolve method blocks the entire thread until it returns. This can cause latencies, especially in single-threaded processes.

DNS queries resolve asynchronously on the following platforms:

NOTE Follow the discussion in Async DNS resolution (#13619) for more details.

Resolves a domain that best matches the given options.

Resolves a domain that best matches the given options.

Resolves domain for the TCP protocol and returns an Array of possible Addrinfo.

Resolves a domain for the TCP protocol with STREAM type, and yields each possible Addrinfo.

Resolves domain for the UDP protocol and returns an Array of possible Addrinfo.

Resolves a domain for the UDP protocol with DGRAM type, and yields each possible Addrinfo.

Appends this struct's name and instance variables names and values to the given IO.

Returns an IPAddress matching this addrinfo.

Resolves a domain that best matches the given options.

Resolves a domain that best matches the given options.

Yields each possible Addrinfo resolution since a domain may resolve to many IP. Implementations are supposed to try all the addresses until the socket is connected (or bound) or there are no addresses to try anymore.

Raising is an expensive operation, so instead of raising on a connect or bind error, just to rescue it immediately after, the block is expected to return the error instead, which will be raised once there are no more addresses to try.

The iteration will be stopped once the block returns something that isn't an Exception (e.g. a Socket or nil).

Resolves domain for the TCP protocol and returns an Array of possible Addrinfo. See #resolve for details.

Resolves a domain for the TCP protocol with STREAM type, and yields each possible Addrinfo. See #resolve for details.

Resolves domain for the UDP protocol and returns an Array of possible Addrinfo. See #resolve for details.

This is the abstract interface that implements Crystal::EventLoop for polling based UNIX targets, such as epoll (linux), kqueue (bsd), or poll (posix) syscalls. This class only implements the generic parts for the external world to interact with the loop. A specific implementation is required to handle the actual syscalls. See Crystal::Epoll::EventLoop and Crystal::Kqueue::EventLoop.

The event loop registers the fd into the kernel data structures when an IO operation would block, then keeps it there until the fd is closed.

NOTE the fds must have O_NONBLOCK set.

It is possible to have multiple event loop instances, but an fd can only be in one instance at a time. When trying to block from another loop, the fd will be removed from its associated loop and added to the current one (this is automatic). Trying to move a fd to another loop with pending waiters is unsupported and will raise an exception. See PollDescriptor#remove.

A timed event such as sleep or select timeout follows the following logic:

The timer will eventually trigger and resume the fiber. When an IO operation on fd would block, the loop follows the following logic:

When the IO operation is ready, the fiber will eventually be resumed (one fiber at a time). If it's an IO operation, the operation is tried again which may block again, until the operation succeeds or an error occurred (e.g. closed, broken pipe).

If the IO operation has a timeout, the event is also registered into @timers before suspending the fiber, then after resume it will raise IO::TimeoutError if the event timed out, and continue otherwise.

## while¶

**URL:** https://crystal-lang.org/reference/1.18/syntax_and_semantics/while.html

**Contents:**
- while¶
- Checking the condition at the end of a loop¶
- As an expression¶

A while executes its body as long as its condition is truthy.

The condition is first tested and, if truthy, the body is executed. That is, the body might never be executed.

Similar to an if, if a while's condition is a variable, the variable is guaranteed to not be nil inside the body. If the condition is an var.is_a?(Type) test, var is guaranteed to be of type Type inside the body. And if the condition is a var.responds_to?(:method), var is guaranteed to be of a type that responds to that method.

The type of a variable after a while depends on the type it had before the while and the type it had before leaving the while's body:

If you need to execute the body at least once and then check for a breaking condition, you can do this:

Or use loop, found in the standard library:

The value of a while is the value of the break expression that exits the while's body:

If the while loop ends normally (because its condition became false), the value is nil:

break expressions with no arguments also return nil:

break expressions with multiple arguments are packed into Tuple instances:

The type of a while is the union of the types of all break expressions in the body, plus Nil because the condition can fail:

However, if the condition is exactly the true literal, then its effect is excluded from the return value and return type:

In particular, a while true expression with no breaks has the NoReturn type, since the loop can never be exited in the same scope:

**Examples:**

Example 1 (julia):
```julia
while some_condition
  do_this
end
```

Example 2 (markdown):
```markdown
a = 1
while some_condition
  # a : Int32 | String
  a = "hello"
  # a : String
  a.size
end
# a : Int32 | String
```

Example 3 (julia):
```julia
while true
  do_something
  break if some_condition
end
```

Example 4 (julia):
```julia
loop do
  do_something
  break if some_condition
end

## Union types¶

**URL:** https://crystal-lang.org/reference/1.18/syntax_and_semantics/union_types.html

**Contents:**
- Union types¶
- Union types rules¶
  - Union of classes and structs under the same hierarchy¶
  - Union of tuples of the same size¶
  - Union of named tuples with the same keys¶

The type of a variable or expression can consist of multiple types. This is called a union type. For example, when assigning to a same variable inside different if branches:

At the end of the if, a will have the Int32 | String type, read "the union of Int32 and String". This union type is created automatically by the compiler. At runtime, a will of course be of one type only. This can be seen by invoking the class method:

The compile-time type can be seen by using typeof:

A union can consist of an arbitrary large number of types. When invoking a method on an expression whose type is a union type, all types in the union must respond to the method, otherwise a compile-time error is given. The type of the method call is the union type of the return types of those methods.

If necessary a variable can be defined as a union type at compile time

In the general case, when two types T1 and T2 are combined, the result is a union T1 | T2. However, there are a few cases where the resulting type is a different type.

If T1 and T2 are under the same hierarchy, and their nearest common ancestor Parent is not Reference, Struct, Int, Float nor Value, the resulting type is Parent+. This is called a virtual type, which basically means the compiler will now see the type as being Parent or any of its subtypes.

The union of two tuples of the same size results in a tuple type that has the union of the types in each position.

The union of two named tuples with the same keys (regardless of their order) results in a named tuple type that has the union of the types in each key. The order of the keys will be the ones from the tuple on the left hand side.

**Examples:**

Example 1 (julia):
```julia
if 1 + 2 == 3
  a = 1
else
  a = "hello"
end

a # : Int32 | String
```

Example 2 (markdown):
```markdown
# The runtime type
a.class # => Int32
```

Example 3 (markdown):
```markdown
# The compile-time type
typeof(a) # => Int32 | String
```

Example 4 (markdown):
```markdown
# to_s is defined for Int32 and String, it returns String
a.to_s # => String

a + 1 # Error, because String#+(Int32) isn't defined
```

The status of a terminated process. Returned by Process#wait.

Returns true if this reference is the same as other.

Returns true if the process terminated abnormally.

Returns a textual description of this process status.

Returns the exit code of the process if it exited normally (#normal_exit?).

Returns the exit code of the process if it exited normally.

Returns a platform-independent reason why the process terminated.

If #signal_exit? is true, returns the Signal the process received and didn't handle.

DEPRECATED Use #exit_signal? instead.

Returns the exit Signal or nil if there is none.

Platform-specific exit status code, which usually contains either the exit code or a termination signal.

DEPRECATED Use #exit_reason, #exit_code, or #system_exit_status instead

See Object#hash(hasher)

Prints a textual representation of the process status to io.

Returns true if the process terminated normally.

Returns true if the process was terminated by a signal.

Returns true if the process exited normally with an exit code of 0.

Returns the exit status as indicated by the operating system.

Prints a textual representation of the process status to io.

Returns a textual representation of the process status.

Returns true if this reference is the same as other. Invokes same?.

Returns true if the process terminated abnormally.

Equivalent to ExitReason#abnormal?

Returns a textual description of this process status.

ExitReason#description provides the specific messages for non-signal exits.

Returns the exit code of the process if it exited normally (#normal_exit?).

Raises RuntimeError if the status describes an abnormal exit.

Returns the exit code of the process if it exited normally.

Returns nil if the status describes an abnormal exit.

Returns a platform-independent reason why the process terminated.

If #signal_exit? is true, returns the Signal the process received and didn't handle. Will raise if #signal_exit? is false.

Available only on Unix-like operating systems.

NOTE #exit_reason is preferred over this method as a portable alternative which also works on Windows.

DEPRECATED Use #exit_signal? instead.

Returns the exit Signal or nil if there is none.

On Windows returns always nil.

Platform-specific exit status code, which usually contains either the exit code or a termination signal. The other Process::Status methods extract the values from #exit_status.

DEPRECATED Use #exit_reason, #exit_code, or #system_exit_status instead

See Object#hash(hasher)

Prints a textual representation of the process status to io.

The result is similar to #to_s, but prefixed by the type name, delimited by square brackets, and constants use full paths: Process::Status[0], Process::Status[1], Process::Status[Signal::HUP], Process::Status[LibC::STATUS_CONTROL_C_EXIT].

Returns true if the process terminated normally.

Equivalent to ExitReason::Normal

Returns true if the process was terminated by a signal.

NOTE In contrast to WIFSIGNALED in glibc, the status code 0x7E (SIGSTOP) is considered a signal.

Returns true if the process exited normally with an exit code of 0.

Returns the exit status as indicated by the operating system.

It can encode exit codes and termination signals and is platform-specific.

Prints a textual representation of the process status to io.

A normal exit status prints the numerical value (0, 1 etc) or a named status (e.g. STATUS_CONTROL_C_EXIT on Windows). A signal exit status prints the name of the Signal member (HUP, INT, etc.).

Returns a textual representation of the process status.

A normal exit status prints the numerical value (0, 1 etc) or a named status (e.g. STATUS_CONTROL_C_EXIT on Windows). A signal exit status prints the name of the Signal member (HUP, INT, etc.).

**Examples:**

Example 1 (yaml):
```yaml
Process::Status.new(0).description # => "Process exited normally"
process = Process.new("sleep", ["10"])
process.terminate
process.wait.description # => "Process received and didn't handle signal TERM (15)"
```

Example 2 (javascript):
```javascript
Process.run("true").exit_code                                # => 0
Process.run("exit 123", shell: true).exit_code               # => 123
Process.new("sleep", ["10"]).tap(&.terminate).wait.exit_code # RuntimeError: Abnormal exit has no exit code
```

**Contents:**
- module Comparable(T)
- Overview
- Direct including types
- Defined in:
- Instance Method Summary
- Instance Method Detail

The Comparable mixin is used by classes whose objects may be ordered.

Including types must provide an <=> method, which compares the receiver against another object, returning:

Comparable uses <=> to implement the conventional comparison operators (<, <=, #==, >=, and >). All of these return false when <=> returns nil.

Note that returning nil is only useful when defining a partial comparable relationship. One such example is float values: they are generally comparable, except for NaN. If none of the values of a type are comparable between each other, Comparable shouldn't be included.

NOTE When nil is returned from <=>, Array#sort and related sorting methods will perform slightly slower.

Compares this object to other based on the receiver’s <=> method, returning true if it returns a negative number.

Compares this object to other based on the receiver’s <=> method, returning true if it returns a value equal or less then 0.

The comparison operator.

Compares this object to other based on the receiver’s <=> method, returning true if it returns 0.

Compares this object to other based on the receiver’s <=> method, returning true if it returns a value greater then 0.

Compares this object to other based on the receiver’s <=> method, returning true if it returns a value equal or greater than 0.

Clamps a value between min and max.

Clamps a value within range.

Compares this object to other based on the receiver’s <=> method, returning true if it returns a negative number.

Compares this object to other based on the receiver’s <=> method, returning true if it returns a value equal or less then 0.

The comparison operator. Returns 0 if the two objects are equal, a negative number if this object is considered less than other, a positive number if this object is considered greater than other, or nil if the two objects are not comparable.

Subclasses define this method to provide class-specific ordering.

The comparison operator is usually used to sort values:

Compares this object to other based on the receiver’s <=> method, returning true if it returns 0.

Also returns true if this and other are the same object.

Compares this object to other based on the receiver’s <=> method, returning true if it returns a value greater then 0.

Compares this object to other based on the receiver’s <=> method, returning true if it returns a value equal or greater than 0.

Clamps a value between min and max.

Clamps a value within range.

**Examples:**

Example 1 (json):
```json
# Sort in a descending way:
[3, 1, 2].sort { |x, y| y <=> x } # => [3, 2, 1]

# Sort in an ascending way:
[3, 1, 2].sort { |x, y| x <=> y } # => [1, 2, 3]
```

Example 2 (javascript):
```javascript
5.clamp(10, 100)   # => 10
50.clamp(10, 100)  # => 50
500.clamp(10, 100) # => 100

5.clamp(10, nil)  # => 10
50.clamp(10, nil) # => 50

5.clamp(nil, 10)  # => 5
50.clamp(nil, 10) # => 10
```

Example 3 (javascript):
```javascript
5.clamp(10..100)   # => 10
50.clamp(10..100)  # => 50
500.clamp(10..100) # => 100

5.clamp(10..)  # => 10
50.clamp(10..) # => 50

5.clamp(..10)  # => 5
50.clamp(..10) # => 10
```

A Deque ("double-ended queue") is a collection of objects of type T that behaves much like an Array.

Deque has a subset of Array's API. It performs better than an Array when there are frequent insertions or deletions of items near the beginning or the end.

The most typical use case of a Deque is a queue: use #push to add items to the end of the queue and #shift to get and remove the item at the beginning of the queue.

This Deque is implemented with a dynamic array used as a circular buffer.

Returns the additive identity of this type.

Creates a new Deque of the given size filled with the same value in each position.

Creates a new Deque that copies its items from an Array.

Creates a new empty Deque backed by a buffer that is initially initial_capacity big.

Creates a new empty Deque

Creates a new Deque of the given size and invokes the block once for each index of the deque, assigning the block's value in that index.

Returns true if it is passed a Deque and equals? returns true for both deques, the caller and the argument.

Removes all elements from self.

Returns a new Deque that has this deque's elements cloned.

Appends the elements of other to self, and returns self.

Removes all items from self that are equal to obj.

Deletes the item that is present at the index.

Returns a new Deque that has exactly this deque's elements.

Yields each item in this deque, from first to last.

Insert a new item before the item at index.

Appends a String representation of this object which includes its class name, its object address and the values of all instance variables.

Removes the last n (at most) items in the deque.

Removes and returns the last item.

Removes and returns the last item, if not empty, otherwise executes the given block and returns its value.

Removes and returns the last item, if not empty, otherwise nil.

Adds an item to the end of the deque.

Modifies self, deleting the elements in the collection for which the passed block is truthy.

Modifies self, deleting the elements in the collection for which pattern === element.

Shifts all elements of self to the left n times.

Modifies self, keeping only the elements in the collection for which the passed block is truthy.

Modifies self, keeping only the elements in the collection for which pattern === element.

Removes the first n (at most) items in the deque.

Removes and returns the first item.

Removes and returns the first item, if not empty, otherwise executes the given block and returns its value.

Removes and returns the first item, if not empty, otherwise nil.

Returns the number of elements in the deque.

Appends a short String representation of this object which includes its class name and its object address.

Returns the element at the given index, without doing any bounds check.

Sets the element at the given index to value, without doing any bounds check.

Adds an item to the beginning of the deque.

Returns the additive identity of this type.

This is an empty deque.

Creates a new Deque of the given size filled with the same value in each position.

Creates a new Deque that copies its items from an Array.

Creates a new empty Deque backed by a buffer that is initially initial_capacity big.

The initial_capacity is useful to avoid unnecessary reallocations of the internal buffer in case of growth. If you have an estimate of the maximum number of elements a deque will hold, you should initialize it with that capacity for improved execution performance.

Creates a new empty Deque

Creates a new Deque of the given size and invokes the block once for each index of the deque, assigning the block's value in that index.

Concatenation. Returns a new Deque built by concatenating two deques together to create a third. The type of the new deque is the union of the types of both the other deques.

Returns true if it is passed a Deque and equals? returns true for both deques, the caller and the argument.

Removes all elements from self.

Returns a new Deque that has this deque's elements cloned. That is, it returns a deep copy of this deque.

Use #dup if you want a shallow copy.

Appends the elements of other to self, and returns self.

Removes all items from self that are equal to obj.

Deletes the item that is present at the index. Items to the right of this one will have their indices decremented. Raises IndexError if trying to delete an element outside the deque's range.

Returns a new Deque that has exactly this deque's elements. That is, it returns a shallow copy of this deque.

Yields each item in this deque, from first to last.

Do not modify the deque while using this variant of #each!

Insert a new item before the item at index. Items to the right of this one will have their indices incremented.

Appends a String representation of this object which includes its class name, its object address and the values of all instance variables.

Removes the last n (at most) items in the deque.

Removes and returns the last item. Raises IndexError if empty.

Removes and returns the last item, if not empty, otherwise executes the given block and returns its value.

Removes and returns the last item, if not empty, otherwise nil.

Removes and returns the first item, if not empty, otherwise executes the given block and returns its value.

Removes and returns the first item, if not empty, otherwise nil.

Returns the number of elements in the deque.

Appends a short String representation of this object which includes its class name and its object address.

Returns the element at the given index, without doing any bounds check.

Indexable makes sure to invoke this method with index in 0...size, so converting negative indices to positive ones is not needed here.

Clients never invoke this method directly. Instead, they access elements with #[](index) and #[]?(index).

This method should only be directly invoked if you are absolutely sure the index is in bounds, to avoid a bounds check for a small boost of performance.

Sets the element at the given index to value, without doing any bounds check.

Indexable::Mutable makes sure to invoke this method with index in 0...size, so converting negative indices to positive ones is not needed here.

Clients never invoke this method directly. Instead, they modify elements with #[]=(index, value).

This method should only be directly invoked if you are absolutely sure the index is in bounds, to avoid a bounds check for a small boost of performance.

Adds an item to the beginning of the deque.

no parallelism issues, but let's clean-up anyway

reset the mutexes since another thread may have acquired the lock of one event loop, which would prevent closing file descriptors for example.

Tells a blocking run loop to no longer wait for events to activate. It may for example enqueue a NOOP event with an immediate (or past) timeout. Having activated an event, the loop shall return, allowing the blocked thread to continue.

Should be a NOOP when the loop isn't running or is running in a nonblocking mode.

NOTE we assume that multiple threads won't run the event loop at the same time in parallel, but this assumption may change in the future!

Writes the contents of slice into this IO.

Creates a new IO::Sized which wraps io, and can read a maximum of read_size bytes. If sync_close is set, calling #close calls #close on the underlying IO.

IO defines this is a no-op method, but including types may override.

Returns true if this IO is closed.

IO defines returns false, but including types may override.

Peeks into this IO, if possible.

The returned bytes are only valid data until a next call to any method that reads from this IO is invoked.

By default this method returns nil, but IO implementations that provide buffering or wrap other IOs should override this method.

Reads at most slice.size bytes from this IO into slice. Returns the number of bytes read, which is 0 if and only if there is no more data to read (so checking for 0 is the way to detect end of file).

Reads a single byte from this IO. Returns nil if there is no more data to read.

The number of remaining bytes to be read.

## to_unsafe¶

**Contents:**
- to_unsafe¶

If a type defines a to_unsafe method, when passing it to C the value returned by this method will be passed. For example:

This is very useful for defining wrappers of C types without having to explicitly transform them to their wrapped values.

For example, the String class implements to_unsafe to return UInt8*:

**Examples:**

Example 1 (python):
```python
lib C
  fun exit(status : Int32) : NoReturn
end

class IntWrapper
  def initialize(@value : Int32)
  end

  def to_unsafe
    @value
  end
end

wrapper = IntWrapper.new(1)
C.exit(wrapper) # wrapper.to_unsafe is passed to C function which has type Int32
```

Example 2 (c):
```c
lib C
  fun printf(format : UInt8*, ...) : Int32
end

a = 1
b = 2
C.printf "%d + %d = %d\n", a, b, a + b
```

## case¶

**Contents:**
- case¶
- Tuple literal¶
  - Tuple size must match¶
  - Underscore allowed¶
  - Implicit-object allowed¶
  - Comparing against a type will perform an is_a? check¶
- Exhaustive case¶
  - Union type checks¶
  - Bool values¶
  - Enum values¶

A case is a control expression which functions a bit like pattern matching. It allows writing a chain of if-else-if with a small change in semantic and some more powerful constructs.

In its basic form, it allows matching a value against other values:

For comparing an expression against a case's subject, the compiler uses the case subsumption operator ===. It is defined as a method on Object and can be overridden by subclasses to provide meaningful semantics in case statements. For example, Class defines case subsumption as when an object is an instance of that class, Regex as when the value matches the regular expression and Range as when the value is included in that range.

If a when's expression is a type, is_a? is used. Additionally, if the case expression is a variable or a variable assignment the type of the variable is restricted:

You can invoke a method on the case's expression in a when by using the implicit-object syntax:

You may use then after the when condition to place the body on a single line.

Finally, you can omit the case's value:

This sometimes leads to code that is more natural to read.

When a case expression is a tuple literal there are a few semantic differences if a when condition is also a tuple literal.

Using in instead of when produces an exhaustive case expression; in an exhaustive case, it is a compile-time error to omit any of the required in conditions. An exhaustive case cannot contain any when or else clauses.

The compiler supports the following in conditions:

If case's expression is a union value, each of the union types may be used as a condition:

If case's expression is a Bool value, the true and false literals may be used as conditions:

If case's expression is a non-flags enum value, its members may be used as conditions, either as constant or predicate method.

The conditions must exhaust all possible combinations of the case expression's elements:

**Examples:**

Example 1 (typescript):
```typescript
case exp
when value1, value2
  do_something
when value3
  do_something_else
else
  do_another_thing
end

# The above is the same as:
tmp = exp
if value1 === tmp || value2 === tmp
  do_something
elsif value3 === tmp
  do_something_else
else
  do_another_thing
end
```

Example 2 (markdown):
```markdown
case var
when String
  # var : String
  do_something
when Int32
  # var : Int32
  do_something_else
else
  # here var is neither a String nor an Int32
  do_another_thing
end

# The above is the same as:
if var.is_a?(String)
  do_something
elsif var.is_a?(Int32)
  do_something_else
else
  do_another_thing
end
```

Example 3 (typescript):
```typescript
case num
when .even?
  do_something
when .odd?
  do_something_else
end

# The above is the same as:
tmp = num
if tmp.even?
  do_something
elsif tmp.odd?
  do_something_else
end
```

Example 4 (julia):
```julia
case exp
when value1, value2 then do_something
when value3         then do_something_else
else                     do_another_thing
end
```
